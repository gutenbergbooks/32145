<h2>MEMOIR AND CRITICISM<br />
ON THE<br />
WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.</h2>


<p>The poetry of each age may be considered as vitally connected with, and
as vividly reflective of, its character and progress, as either its
politics or its religion. You see the nature of the soil of a garden in
its tulips and roses, as much as in its pot-herbs and its towering
trees. We purpose, accordingly, to compare briefly the poetry of the
past and of the present centuries, as indices of some of the points of
contrast between the two, and to show also how, and through what causes,
the one grew into the other. This will be a fitting introduction to a
consideration of the life and writings of the first of the poets of this
century included in our series, the more as he was in a measure the
father of modern poetry.</p>

<p>It is impossible to take up a volume of the poetry of the eighteenth
century, such as, for instance, Churchill's, or Pope's, or Johnson's,
and to compare it with some of the leading poetical works of the
present, such as the poems of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Byron,
and not to feel as if you were reading the productions of two different
races of beings&mdash;so different are the style, the sentiments, the modes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>of thought, the imagery, the temperament, and the spirit of the poets
and the poetry. It is like stepping, we will not say from the frigid,
but from the temperate into the torrid zone. In the one class of authors
you find the prevalence of strong sense, flanked by wit and by fancy,
but without much that can be called imaginative or romantic. In the
other, imagination or fancy is the regnant faculty; and if wit and sense
are there too, they are there as slaves, the "Slaves of the lamp," to
the imperious imaginative power. The style of the one is clear,
masculine, sententious, and measured; that of the other is bold,
unmeasured, diffuse, fervid, and sometimes obscure. The one style may be
compared to a clear crescent; the other to a full, but partially
eclipsed, moon. The sentiment of the one is chiefly the sublimation of
passion: bitter contempt, noble indignation, a proud, stern patriotism,
sometimes united with a sombre, but manly melancholy, are the principal
feelings expressed; that of the other, although occasionally morbid, is
far more varied, more profound, purer, on the whole, and more poetical.
The thought of the one is acute and logical; that of the other aspires
to the deep, if not to the mystical and the transcendental. The subjects
of the poets of the eighteenth century are generally of a dignified cast
(except in the case of satirical productions), such as "The Temple of
Fame," "The Pleasures of Imagination," "The Traveller," "London," and
"The Vanity of Human Wishes." The subjects of the other class are as
varied as their mode of treatment is often daringly peculiar. The
leech-gatherer on his lonely moor, the pedlar on his humble rounds, the
tinker linked by a "fellow-feeling" to the animal he beats and starves,
a mad mariner, a divorced wife, a wandering roué&mdash;such characters as
these have called forth the utmost stretch of the powers of our best
modern poets. The images of the former race of poets are limited to what
are called classical subjects&mdash;including in this term the ancient
mythologies, the incidents in Grecian and Roman story, the more
beautiful objects of nature, and the more popular productions of art.
Those of modern poets acknowledge no boundary&mdash;from the firmament to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>fungus, from Niagara to the nearest puddle, from the cold scalp of Mont
Blanc to the snowball of the schoolboy&mdash;all things are free and open to
the step of their genius, which, like the moonbeam, touches and
beautifies every object on which it rests. The temperament of the two
races is as distinct as their sentiment and style; that of the one
seeming somewhat curbed, if not cold, while that of the other is ardent
always, and often enthusiastic and rapturous. Different also their
spirit; the one being confined and sectarian, alike in politics, in
literature, and in religion; the other, in some of their number, being
liberal to latitudinarianism, and genial to a vice.</p>

<p>We are not at present seeking to settle the precedence of these two
schools of poetry. We love and honour much in both, and think the
criticism small and captious which can be blind to the peculiar merits
of either&mdash;to the terseness, condensation, force of single lines, vigour
of logical thought, and general correctness of the one; or to the
boldness, brilliant diffusion, breadth, and variety of mood and music,
of subject and of treatment, which distinguish the other. It is more
specially our object at present to show how each sprang naturally and
inevitably out of the different ages when they appeared.</p>

<p>Poetry is an age in flower; and the poetry of the nineteenth century has
been a more gorgeous and more tropical flower, because warmer suns have
shone on it, warmer winds blown on it, and larger rains watered its
roots. Indeed, it is almost a wonder that the first half, at least, and
the middle of the eighteenth century, produced so much and such good
poetry. That age was, on the whole, a stagnant and uninteresting one.
There was nothing very deeply to rouse the passions and imaginations of
men. There was, indeed, the usual amount of political squabbles; but
when a Bolingbroke was the most eloquent and admired of parliamentary
orators, what moral grandeur could be expected? There was a Jacobite
faction, perpetually undermining and sometimes breaking out into open
rebellion; but their enthusiasm, save in Scotland, was mingled with no
poetical elements, although there certainly it produced many exquisite
strains of ballad poetry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> Twice or thrice the popular passions broke
forth, and reared up an idol for themselves in the shape of a private
man, exalted for the nonce into a hero; but it is significant to
remember that the two principal of these idols were
<i>calves</i>&mdash;Sacheverel, namely, and Jack Wilkes. The wars in that age were
almost entirely destitute of imaginative interest; those of Marlborough,
such as Blenheim and Ramilies, were just large games of chess, played on
a blood-red board&mdash;who now ever thinks or talks about the battles of
Fontenoy or Minden?&mdash;some tolerable sea-fights, indeed, there were; on
the heights of Abraham a brave man expired in the arms of victory, and a
glory still lingers on the field of Prestonpans and on the bloody plains
of Culloden; but there was no Trafalgar, no Waterloo, and no Inkermann.
The manners of the age were not only dissolute, but grossly and brutally
so. In England, there was no Burns to cast a gleam of poetry even on the
orgies of dissipation; all was as coarse as it was corrupt; it was a
drunken dance of naked satyrs: and disgust at this state of things, we
believe, principally made Burke, contrasting the Continent with England,
to utter the paradox, that vice, by losing all its grossness, lost half
its evil. Foreigners were then, as they are still, more depraved in
morals and filthier in personal habits than we; but they had, and have,
a grace, a politeness, a reticence, and an ease, which gilded, if they
did not lessen, the abominations. The religion of the country was
reduced to a very low point of depression; the churches were filled with
drowsy divines, drowsily reading what they never wrote, to yet drowsier
congregations; many of the upper classes, and of the literary men, were
avowed infidels; till the rise of Methodism, religious enthusiasm in any
class did not exist&mdash;even in Scotland the load of patronage had nearly
extinguished the old fires of Covenanting zeal&mdash;the state of the lower
classes was deplorable, so far, at least, as mental culture and morality
were concerned; cock-fighting, grinning through collars, bull-baiting,
and hard drinking, were their main amusements; the hallowing and
spiritualising influences of the Sabbath-day were scarcely known; and
the upper ranks had no feeling that they were in some measure
respon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>sible for the ignorance and the vice of the lower, and were bound
to circulate education and religion amidst their masses; indeed, how
could they be expected, since they themselves had little education and
less religion to circulate? In science, philosophy, and general
literature, there prevailed a partial syncope and pause. Newton was
dead, and had left no successor; Locke was dead, and had left no
successor. The wits of Queen Anne's reign, Swift, Pope, Arbuthnot,
Steele, and Addison, were dropping off one by one, and for a season none
arose adequate to supply their place. It had altogether become an age of
mediocrity; neither an age of stern conflict, like that of the Puritans,
nor even a fiercely lawless and riotous age, like that of Charles the
Second, nor a transition age, like that of the Revolution, but an age of
a negative and slumbrous character; its only positive qualities were a
generally diffused laxity of principle and corruption of practice; but
its vices, as well as its virtues, were small; it had not virtue to be
greatly good, nor daring to be greatly wicked.</p>

<p>All this told on its poetry; and our wonder, we repeat, is, that it did
not tell more. That it did not, was probably owing to the continued
prevalence of the power of classical literature. That, increased by the
influence of the universities and the great schools, and by the
translations made of its masterpieces by Dryden and Pope, contributed to
produce and maintain purity of taste, in the midst of general
depravation of manners, and to touch many opening minds with the chaste
and manly inspiration of a long past age. Hence the poetry of the first
half of the eighteenth century, while inferior in force and richness to
that of the end of the seventeenth, is superior in good taste, and is
much freer from impurities. To this the imitation of French models, too,
contributed. Still we see the traces of the period very distinctly
marked in its works of art and in its poetry. The paintings of Hogarth,
next to the infinite richness of the painter's invention, and the
accuracy of his observation and touch, testify to the corruption of
these times. They are everlasting libels&mdash;as true, however, as they are
libellous&mdash;on the age of the first two Georges; and we are astonished
how such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> age produced such a genius, as well as grieved to see how
such a genius had no better materials to work on than were furnished by
such an age. It is much the same with the novels of Smollett and
Fielding, and with parts of the poetry of Churchill, Lloyd, and others.
The formal wars of that day, too, were certain to produce formal poetry,
and Blenheim was fitly celebrated in Addison's "Campaign." The sceptical
philosophy then prevalent was faithfully mirrored in Pope's "Essay on
Man," which, exquisite as a work of art, is, in thought, a system of
naturalism set to music; and, while its art is the poet's own, its
doctrine comes from the "fell genius" of St John (Bolingbroke). Up to
Thomson's fine "Ode on the Death of Sir Isaac Newton," and the "Night
Thoughts," the great discoveries of astronomy obtained no poetical
recognition. Religious poetry, properly speaking, there was none; for
the hymns of Watts, although full of piety, can scarcely be called
poems; and the most popular poetry of the time was either founded on the
Latin, or written in imitation of Pope. Johnson's "London" and "Vanity
of Human Wishes" are instances of the former; and of the latter,
specimens too numerous to mention abounded.</p>

<p>Thus it continued till about the middle of the century, when there began
to appear symptoms of a change. First of all, a "fine fat fellow" from
Scotland, who had derived inspiration from the breezes of the Tweed and
the Jed, wrote that noble strain, "The Seasons," with its daguerreotypic
painting of nature, and its generous, healthy enthusiasm, and the
"Castle of Indolence," with its exquisite sketches of character and
scenery, and its rich reproduction of an antique style of poetry.
Thomson's voice did not, indeed, produce a revolution in taste, but it
obtained an audience for a species of writing entirely different from
what then prevailed. Young, next, in a bolder spirit, having broken the
trammels of Pope, which had confined him, soared up through Night and
all its worlds, and brought down genuine inspiration on his adventurous
wing. Dr Johnson, although considerably hampered in his verse by undue
admiration of the mechanical poets, allowed himself greater liberty in
his prose, which glowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> with a deep, if somewhat turbid life, and
rolled on in a strong and solemn current, which often seemed that of
high imagination. Collins, smitten with a true "gadfly," born as one out
of due time, and, alas! "blasted with the celestial fire," he brought,
anticipated, in part, some of the miraculous effects of more modern
poetry. Gray, Mason, and Beattie, three men of unequal name, all wrote
in a different style from Addison, Swift, and Pope, and two of them
displayed genuine, if not very powerful, genius. Then came Percy, with
his "Reliques of Ancient Poetry," which showed what wonders our rude
forefathers had wrought by the force of simple nature; and to the same
end contributed Ossian's Poems, which, whatever their defects, awakened
and startled the literary world, here, in France, and in Germany, by a
panoramic view of that "land of mountain and of flood," which was yet to
attract so many visitors, and to inspire so many bards. The impulse lent
to our prose style by Johnson was followed up by Junius and by Burke,
both of whom shot into the discussions of politics and of passing events
much of the spirit and the power of poetry. Burke especially, even
before the French Revolution effectually roused the world, had given
specimens of fervid prose, combining with matter of fact and the most
compact wisdom, the graces, the spirit, the imagery, and the language of
the highest imagination. Cowper, too, had come, setting religion to
rhythm; and, although "veiling all the lightnings of his song in
sorrow," yet circulating the power of his genius, even more extensively
than the contagion of his grief. Burns, in Scotland, had exhibited his
vein of ardent native genius. And lastly, the French Revolution lifted
up its volcano voice, and said to the world of literature and song, as
well as to the world at large, "<i>Sleep no more</i>."</p>

<p>From this date the character of poetry was changed, and began to assume
that antagonistic attitude to the school of Dryden and Pope which we
described in our commencing remarks, and which yet continues. Britain
got engaged in a Titanic warfare, an earthshaking contest&mdash;a war of
opinion, not of treaties&mdash;of peoples, not of kings; and instead of
"Campaigns," our poets indited Odes to France, to the Departing Year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
hymns to "Carnage, God's Daughter," and "Visions of Don Roderick." Our
religion became more intense and earnest, and this produced, on the one
hand, the fine religious verses of a Montgomery, the poetical prose of a
Foster and a Hall, and the rapt effusions of a Coleridge and Wordsworth;
and, on the other hand, told even on our scepticism, which became more
impassioned too, and wielded against religion a bar of burning iron,
like "Queen Mab," instead of a piece of polished wood, like the "Essay
on Man." Our morality improved, in outward decorum, at least, and the
last remains of the indecency of former times were swept away&mdash;to
re-appear, indeed, afterwards partially in "Don Juan." Poetry, too,
after coquetting for a little, not very gracefully, with Science in
Darwin's "Botanic Garden," and "Temple of Nature," aspired to the hand
of Philosophy; and the Lake poets and others not merely found a poetic
worship in nature, but set to song many of the wondrous speculations of
modern psychology. A taste for ancient, simple poetic writers spread
widely, and produced Scott's brilliant imitations of ballad poetry, and
Wordsworth's early lyrical strains. Popular principles began to prevail,
and knowledge to circulate among the lower classes; and they learned not
only to read poems with relish, but their "poor dumb mouths" ever and
anon were opened to utter a stern and vigorous poetry of their own.
Along with these and other beneficial changes, there were, indeed, much
extravagance and exaggeration introduced. With the formality and
stiffness, much of the point, pith, and correctness of the old school
was lost&mdash;a good deal of false enthusiasm and pretence, mingled with the
real inspiration; jackdaws and mocking-birds, as well as doves and
eagles, abounded. But, on the whole, we question if any age of the world
has equalled the early part of the nineteenth century, in the quantity,
or in the quality, in the power, depth, brilliance, or variety of its
poetry.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">William Lisle Bowles</span>&mdash;whom we have ventured to call the father of modern
poetry, since not only was he first in the field, but since his sonnets
inspired the more powerful muse of Coleridge&mdash;was descended from an
ancient and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>spectable family in Wiltshire. His grandfather and father
were both clergymen in the Church of England. The poet was born in
King's Sutton, and baptized there on the 25th of September 1762. In the
year 1776 he was placed on the Wykeham foundation at Winchester. His
master was Dr Joseph Warton, who, seeing genius disguised under the veil
of his pupil's boyish timidity, encouraged him in his efforts, was
warmly loved by Bowles in return, and transmitted to him his very
moderate estimate of the poetry and character of Pope. Bowles has
testified his gratitude to his teacher in his very pleasing "Monody on
the Death of Dr Warton." During the last year he passed at Winchester,
Bowles was captain of the school. In the year 1781, he was elected a
scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, having selected this college,
because the brother of his old master, Thomas Warton, was residing
there. In 1783, he gained the Chancellor's prize for Latin verse&mdash;"Calpe
Obessa; or, The Siege of Gibraltar," being the subject of the poem. At
college he got no fellowship, nor did he procure his degree till 1792.
At an early age, he is said to have been unsuccessful in his suit to a
Miss Romilly, a niece of Sir Samuel Romilly; and this rejection it was
which first stung him into rhyme and rambling; for, in order to deaden
his feelings, he traversed the north of England, Scotland, and parts of
the Continent. His first production consisted of fourteen sonnets,
published in 1789, and was followed the same year by "Verses to John
Howard." In 1790, he reprinted these and various other pieces written in
the interval, and in 1798 they were reproduced with illustrations. They
became so popular, that by the year 1805 they had reached a ninth
edition.</p>

<p>Almost every year from 1798 till the end of his life, Mr Bowles was
adding to his works new poems of various merit. In 1798, appeared his
"Coombe Ellen, and St Michael's Mount;" in 1799, "The Battle of the
Nile;" in 1801, "The Sorrows of Switzerland;" in 1803, "The Picture;" in
1805, the "Spirit of Discovery;" in 1806, "Bowden Hill;" in 1815, "The
Missionary of the Andes;" in 1822, "The Grave of the Last Saxon;" in
1823, "Ellen Gray;" in 1828, "Days De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>parted;" in 1833, "St John in
Patmos;" and in 1837, a volume entitled "Scenes and Shadows of Days
Departed, a Narrative;" besides "The Village Verse-book," a very popular
selection of simple poetry.</p>

<p>The events of this gentleman's private and professional life were of no
particular interest. Having entered holy orders, he resided for many
years as curate in Donhead St Andrew, in Wilts, where he remained till
1804, when he was appointed vicar of Bremhill&mdash;a situation which he
continued to fill till the end of his long life. In 1792, he was
presented to the vicarage of Checklade, in Wiltshire, which he resigned,
after an incumbency of five years, on receiving another presentation to
the rectory of Dumbleton, Gloucestershire. This living he retained till
his death, although he never resided at either Dumbleton or Checklade.
In 1804, through Archbishop Moore, he was made vicar of Bremhill, and,
the same year, prebend of Stratford in the cathedral church of
Salisbury. In 1828, he was elected canon-residentiary. He had, in 1818,
been appointed chaplain to the Prince Regent. He resided constantly at
Bremhill for twenty-five years. After he was elected canon, however, he
abode partly, and in the latter years of his life principally, in the
town of Salisbury. In 1797, he married Magdalene, daughter of the Rev.
Charles Wake, D.D., prebendary of Westminster, and grand-daughter of
Archbishop Wake. She died some years before her husband, and left no
family. Bowles himself expired at Salisbury, after a gradual decay of
the vital powers, April 7, 1850, aged eighty-eight years. His life is
about to be written at large by his kinsman, Dr J. Bowles, assisted by
Mr Alaric Watts, to whom the publisher is indebted for the means of
supplying a complete copyright edition of the poet's works.</p>

<p>Bowles was a diligent pastor, an eloquent preacher, an active justice,
and in every way an estimable man. Even Byron, who met him at Mr
Rogers', in London, speaks of him as a "pleasant, gentlemanly man&mdash;a
good fellow for a parson." Moore, in his Diary, speaks with delight of
his mixture of talent and simplicity. In his introduction to "Scenes
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> Shadows," Bowles gives some interesting particulars of his early
life. In <i>Blackwood</i>, for August 1828, there is a very entertaining
account of Bremhill Parsonage.</p>

<p>As an author, he appears in three aspects&mdash;as a writer on typography, as
an editor and controversialist, and as a poet. In 1828, he produced a
volume entitled "The Parochial History of Bremhill," and shortly
afterwards, his "History of Lacock Abbey," containing much interesting
antiquarian lore. To this succeeded a still more ingenious and recondite
work, entitled "Hermes Britannicus," besides some less important
writings of a similar kind. His "Life of Bishop Ken," which appeared in
1830 and 1831, might be considered as belonging to the same category of
learned antiquarian lucubrations.</p>

<p>In 1807, he published an edition of Pope, in ten volumes, for which he
received £300. The life prefixed to this edition led to the celebrated
controversy between Bowles, on the one hand, and Campbell, Byron,
Roscoe, Octavius Gilchrist, and the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, on the other. In
our life of Pope, we hope to devote a few pages to the principal
questions which were mooted in this controversy. We may simply say, at
present, that we think Bowles was, in the main, right, although he laid
himself open to retort at many points, and displayed an <i>animus</i> against
Pope, both as a man and a poet, which he in vain sought to disclaim, and
which somewhat detracted from the value of his criticisms. He gained,
however, the three objects at which he aimed:&mdash;he proved that Pope was
only at the head of the <i>second</i> rank of poets&mdash;that, as a man, he was
guilty of many meannesses, and had a prurient imagination and pen&mdash;and
that the objects of artificial life are, <i>per se</i>, less fitted for the
purposes of poetry than those of nature, and than the passions of the
human heart. In this controversy, as well as in some
after-skirmishes,&mdash;in his letters to Lord Brougham, "On the Position and
Incomes of the Cathedral Clergy,"&mdash;in a letter to Sir James Mackintosh,
on the Increase of Crime,&mdash;and in a sharp fight with the Rev. Edward
Duke, F.S.A., on the Antiquities of Wiltshire&mdash;Bowles displayed amazing
<span class="smcap">PLUCK</span>, and no small controversial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span> acuteness and dexterity. Like another
Ajax, he took enemy after enemy on his single shield, and by his
pertinacity and perseverance, he succeeded in beating them all. He stood
at first alone, and had very formidable opponents. But he bated not one
jot of heart or hope; and, by and by, Southey, <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>,
and others, came to his aid, and, finally, William Hazlitt saw, with his
inevitable eye, the real merits of the case, and (substantially
inclining to the Bowles side) settled, by a paper in the <i>London
Magazine</i>, the question for ever. As a controversialist, Bowles is
rather noisy, flippant, and fierce; and his reply to Byron, while
superior to the noble bard's letter in argument, is far inferior in easy
and trenchant vigour of style. His writings on the Pope controversy
consist of "A Letter to Thomas Campbell," "Two Letters to Lord Byron,"
"A Final Appeal to the Public relative to Pope," and (more last words!),
"Lessons in Criticism to William Roscoe, and Farther Lessons to a
Quarterly Reviewer." All are exceedingly readable and clever.</p>

<p>It is curious contrasting the spirit of Bowles' prose&mdash;his severity&mdash;his
pugnacity&mdash;his irritability, with the mild qualities of his poetry. The
leading element in all his poetical works is sentiment,&mdash;warm, mellow,
tender, and often melancholy sentiment. He has no profound thought&mdash;no
powerful pictures of passion&mdash;no creative imagination&mdash;but over all his
poetry lies a sweet autumnal moonlight of pensive and gentle feeling. In
his larger poems, he is often diffuse and verbose, and you see more
effort than energy. But in his smaller, and especially in his sonnets,
and his pieces descriptive of nature, Bowles is always true to his own
heart, and therefore always successful. How delightful such sonnets as
his "Morning Bells," "Absence," "Bereavement," and his poems entitled,
"Monody at Matlock," "Coombe-Ellen," "On Hearing the 'Messiah,'" <i>etc.</i>!
We trust that many, after reading these and the others (some of which
were never before published) contained in our volumes, will be ready to
express the gratitude of their hearts through the medium of the
following beautiful sonnet:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE TO WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My heart has thanked thee, Bowles! for those soft strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sadness soothes me like the murmuring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild bees in the sunny showers of spring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hence, not callous to the mourner's pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through youth's gay prime and thornless paths I went:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the mightier throes of mind began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drove me forth a thought-bewildered man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their mild and manliest melancholy lent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mingled charm, such as the pang consigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slumber, though the big tear it renewed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding a strange mysterious pleasure brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the wavy and tumultuous mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Great Spirit erst with plastic sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved on the darkness of the unformed deep."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His larger poems are perhaps more distinguished by the ambition of their
themes than by the success of their treatment. His particular theory
about the superiority of the works of nature as poetical subjects
perhaps led him to a too uniform selection of its grander features,
while undoubtedly his genius fitted him better for depicting its softer
and smaller objects. He excels far more in interpreting the language of
the bells, now of Ostend, and now of Oxford&mdash;in describing the dingles
of Coombe Ellen&mdash;in echoing the fall of the river Avon, heard in his
sick-chamber at Bath&mdash;or in catching on his mind-mirror the "Distant
View of England from the Sea"&mdash;than in coping with the dark recesses of
the American forest, following the daring Gama round his Cape of Storms,
standing with Noah on the brow of the tremendous mountain Caff, the hill
of demons and griffins, and seeing the globe at his feet, or in walking
beside the Seer of all time, in that "isle which is called Patmos,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Placed far amid the melancholy main."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He is more at home in the beautiful than in the sublime&mdash;more a Warton
than a Milton&mdash;and may be rather likened to a bee murmuring her dim
music in the bells of flowers, than to an eagle dallying with the
tempest, and binding dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>tant oceans and chains of mountains together by
the living link of his swift and strong pinion. Yet his "Spirit of
Discovery" contains some bold fancy. Take this, for instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Andes, sweeping the horizon's tract,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mightiest of mountains! whose eternal snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feel not the nearer sun; whose umbrage chills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murmuring ocean; whose <i>volcanic fires</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A thousand nations view, hung, like the moon,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>High in the middle waste of heaven</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The Missionary" (of which Byron writes in some playful verses to
Murray,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I've read the Missionary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pretty! Very!")<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>contains much vivid description and interesting narrative; and "St John
in Patmos," if scarcely up to the mark of the transcendent theme, has a
good deal of picturesque and striking poetry. Perhaps the most
interesting of all his minor poems is that entitled "Childe Harold's
Last Pilgrimage," quoted, we remember, in Moore's Life of Byron. As
proceeding from one whom the angry and unhappy Childe had often insulted
in public and laughed at in private, it was as graceful in spirit as it
is elegant in composition. "Revenge," it has been said, "is a feast for
the gods;" and the saying is true if meant of that species of revenge
which gains its end by forgiveness. An act so noble and generous as the
writing of this, is calculated to set the memory of Bowles still higher
than all his poetry.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE1" id="PREFACE1"></a>PREFACE.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>The estimation of a Poem of this nature must depend, first, on its
arrangement, plan, and disposition; secondly, on the judgment,
propriety, and feeling with which&mdash;in just and proper succession
and relief&mdash;picture, pathos, moral and religious reflections,
historical notices, or affecting incidents, are interwoven. The
reader will, in the next place, attend to the versification, or
music, in which the thoughts are conveyed. Shakspeare and Milton
are the great masters of the verse I have adopted. But who can be
heard after them? The reader, however, will at least find no
specimens of sonorous harmony ending with such significant words as
"of," "and," "if," "but," <i>etc</i> of which we have had lately some
splendid examples. I would therefore only request of him to
observe, that when such passages occur in this poem as "vanishing,"
"hush!" <i>etc.</i> it was from design, and not from want of ear.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>An intermixture of images and characters from common life might be
thought, at first sight, out of keeping with the higher tone of
general colouring; but the interspersion of the comic, provided the
due mock-heroic stateliness be kept up in the language, has often
the effect of light and shade, as will be apparent on looking at
Cowper's exquisite "Task," although he has often "offended against
taste." The only difficulty is happily to steer "from grave to
gay."</p>

<p>So far respecting the plan, the execution, the versification, and
style. As to the sentiments conveyed in this poem, and in the
notes, I must explicitly declare, that when I am convinced, as a
clergyman and a magistrate, that there has been an increase of
crime, owing, among other causes, to the system pursued by some
"nominal Christians," who <i>will not</i> preach "these three" (faith,
hope, and charity) according to the order of St Paul, but keep two
of these graces, and the greatest of all, out of sight, upon any
human plea or pretension; when they do <i>not</i> preach, "Add to your
faith virtue;" when they will <i>not</i> preach, Christ died for the
sins of "the <i>world</i>, and not for <i>ours</i> only;" when, from any
pleas of their own, or persuaded by any sophistry or faction, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>become, most emphatically, "dumb dogs" to the sublime and
affecting moral parts of that gospel which they have engaged before
God to deliver; and above all, when crimes, as I am verily
persuaded have been, are, and must be, the consequence of such
public preaching,&mdash;leaving others to "stand or fall" to their own
God; I shall be guided by my own understanding, and the plain Word
of God, as I find it earnestly, simply, beautifully, and divinely
set before me by Christ and his Apostles; and so feeling, I shall
as fearlessly deliver my own opinions, being assured, whether
popular or unpopular, whether they offend this man or that, this
sect or that sect, they will not easily be shaken.</p>

<p>I might ask, why did St Paul add, so emphatically, "these three,"
when he enumerated the Christian graces? Doubtless, because he
thought the distinction very important. Why did St Peter say, "Add
to your faith virtue"? Because he thought it equally important and
essential. Why did St John say, "Christ died for the sins of the
whole world, and not for ours only"? Because he thought it equally
important and necessary.</p>

<p>Never omitting the atonement, justification by faith, the fruits of
the Spirit, and never separating faith from its hallowed
fellowship, we shall find all other parts of the gospel unite in
harmonious subordination; but if we shade the moral parts down,
leave them out, contradict them, by insidious sophistry, the
Scripture, so far from being "rightly divided," will be discordant
and clashing. The man, be he whom he may, who preaches "faith"
without charity; who preaches "faith without virtue," is as
pernicious and false an expounder of the divine message, as he who
preaches "good works," without their legitimate and only
foundation&mdash;Christian faith.</p>

<p>One would suppose, from the language of some preachers, the
"civil," "decent," "moral" people, from the times of Baxter to the
present, want amendment most. We all know that mere morals, which
have no Christian basis, are not the gospel of Christ; but I might
tell Richard, with great respect notwithstanding, for I respect his
sincerity and his heart, that, at least, "decent," and "civil," and
"moral" people,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are not worse than indecent, immoral, and
uncivil people; and when there are so many of these last, I think a
word or two of reproof would not much hurt them, let the "decent,"
"moral," and "civil" be as <i>wicked</i> as they may.</p>

<p>I hope it is not necessary for me to disclaim, in speaking of
facts, the most remote idea of throwing a slight on the sincerely
pious of any portion of the community; but, if religion does not
invigorate the higher feelings and principles of moral obligation;
if a heartless and hollow jargon is often substituted for the
fundamental laws of Christian obedience; if ostentatious
affectation supersedes the meek, unobtrusive character of feminine
devotion; if a petty peculiarity of system, a kind of conventional
code of godliness, usurps the place of the specific righteousness,
visible in its fruits, "of whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
things are just, whatsoever things are lovely;" if, to be fluent
and flippant in the jargon of this petty peculiarity of code, is
made the criterion of exclusive godliness; when, by thousands and
thousands, after the example of Hawker, and others of the same
school, Christianity is represented as having neither "an <i>if</i>, or
<i>but</i>," the conclusion being left for the innumerable disciples of
such a gospel school; when, because none&mdash;"no, not one"&mdash;is
<i>without sin</i>, and none can stand upright <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>in the sight of Him
whose eyes are too pure to behold iniquity, they who have exercised
themselves to "have a conscience void of offence toward God and
man," though sensible of innumerable offences, are considered, by
implication, before God, as no better than Burkes or Thurtles, for
the imputation of utter depravity must mean this, or be mere hollow
<i>verba et voces</i>; when amusements, or recreations, vicious only in
their excess, are proclaimed as national abominations, while real
abominations stalk abroad, as is the case in large manufacturing
towns, with "the Lord," "the Lord," on the lips of some of the most
depraved; when, from these causes, I do sincerely believe the heart
has been hardened, and the understanding deteriorated, the wide
effects being visible on the great criminal body of the nation,&mdash;I
conceive I do a service to Evangelical Religion by speaking as I
feel of that ludicrous caricature which so often in society usurps
its name, and apes and disgraces its divine character.</p>

<p>I am not among those who divide the clergy of the Church of England
into classes; and I think it my duty ingenuously to declare, that
the opinions I have expressed of the effects of such public
doctrines as I have described, be they preached or published by
whom they may, were written without communication with any one
living. I think it right to declare this, most explicitly, lest the
distinguished person to whom this poem is inscribed, might be
supposed to have any participation in such sentiments; though, I
trust, no possible objection could be made to the manly avowal of
my opinion of the injurious effects of Antinomian, or shades of
Antinomian doctrines.</p>

<p>Further, the object of my remarks is <i>not</i> piety, but ostentatious
publicity and affectation,&mdash;far more disgusting in the assumed garb
of female piety than under any shape; and often attended by
<i>acting</i> far more disgusting than any acting on any stage.</p>


<h3>BANWELL CAVE.</h3>

<p>The following extract of a letter from Mr Warner will enable the
reader to form his own opinion concerning the vast accumulation of
bones in this cave:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The sagacity of Mr Beard having detected the existence of the
cavern, and his perseverance effected a precipitous descent into
it, the objects offered to his notice were of the most astonishing
and paradoxical description&mdash;'an antre vast,' rude from the hand of
nature, of various elevations, and branching into several recesses;
its floor overspread with a huge mingled mass of bones and mud,
black earth (or decomposed animal matter), and sand from the Severn
sea, which flows about six miles to the northward of Banwell
village. The quantity of bones, and the mode by which they could be
conveyed to, and deposited in, the place they occupied, were points
of equal difficulty to be explained: as the former amounted to
several waggon loads; and as no access to the cavern appeared to
exist, except a fissure from above, utterly incapable, from its
narrow dimensions, of admitting the falling in of any animal larger
than a common sheep; whereas it was evident that huge quadrupeds,
such as unknown beasts of the ox tribe, bears, wolves, and probably
hyenas and tigers, had perished in the cave. But, though the
questions <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> were unanswerable, <i>this</i> conclusion was
irresistibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> forced upon the mind, by the phenomena submitted to
the eye, that, as the receptacle was infinitely too small to
contain such a crowd of animals in their living state, they must
necessarily have occupied it in succession: one portion of them
after another paying the debt of nature, and (leaving their bones
only, as a memorial of their existence on the spot) thus making
room in the cavern for a succeeding set of inhabitants, of
similarly ferocious habits to themselves. The difficulty, indeed,
of the ingress of such beasts into the cave did not long continue
to be invincible; as Mr Beard discovered and cleared out a lateral
aperture in it, sufficiently inclining from the perpendicular, and
sufficiently large in its dimensions, to admit of the easy descent
into this subterraneous apartment of one of its unwieldy tenants,
though loaded with its prey.</p>

<p>"From the circumstances premised, you will probably anticipate my
thoughts on these remarkable phenomena; if not, they are as
follow:&mdash;I consider the cavern to have been formed at the period of
the original deposition and consolidation of the matter
constituting the mountain limestone in which it is found; possibly
by the agency of some elastic gas, imprisoned in the mass, which
prevented the approximation of its particles to each other; or by
some unaccountable interruption to the operation of the usual laws
of its crystallization;&mdash;that, for a long succession of ages
anterior to the Deluge, and previously to man's inhabiting the
colder regions of the earth, Banwell Cave had been inhabited by
successive generations of beasts of prey; which, as hunger
dictated, issued from their den, pursued and slaughtered the
gregarious animals, or wilder quadrupeds, in its neighbourhood; and
dragged them, either bodily or piecemeal, to this retreat, in order
to feast upon them at leisure, and undisturbed;&mdash;that the bottom of
the cavern thus became a kind of charnel-house, of various and
unnumbered beasts;&mdash;that this scene of excursive carnage continued
till 'the flood came,' blending 'the oppressor with the oppressed,'
and mixing the hideous furniture of the den with a quantity of
extraneous matter, brought from the adjoining shore, and subjacent
lands, by the waters of the Deluge, which rolled, surging (as
Kirwan imagines), from the north-western quarter;&mdash;that, previously
to this total submersion, as the flood increased on the lower
grounds, the animals which fed upon them ascended the heights of
Mendip, to escape impending death; and with panic rushed (as many
as could gain entrance) into this dwelling-place of their worst
enemies;&mdash;that numberless birds also, terrified by the elemental
tumult, flew into the same den, as a place of temporary
refuge;&mdash;that the interior of the cavern was speedilly filled by
the roaring Deluge, whose waters, dashing and crushing the various
substances which they embraced, against the rugged rocks, or
against each other; and continuing this violent and incessant
action for at least three months, at length tore asunder every
connected form, separated every skeleton, and produced that
confusion of substances, that scene of <i>disjecta membra</i>, that
mixture and disjunction of bones, which were apparent on the first
inspection of the cavern; and which are now visible in that part of
it which has been hitherto untouched."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Respecting the language of the Poem, I had nearly forgotten one
remark. In almost all the local poems I have read, there is a
confusion of the following nature. A local descriptive poem must
consist, first, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> the graphic view of the scenery around the spot
from whence the view is taken; and, secondly, of the reflections
and feelings which that view may be supposed to excite. The
feelings of the heart naturally associate themselves with the idea
of the tones of the supposed poetical harp; but external scenes are
the province of the pencil, for the harp cannot paint woods and
hills, and therefore, in almost all descriptive poems, the pencil
and the lyre clash. Hence, in one page, the poet speaks of his
lyre, and in the next, when he leaves feelings to paint to the eye,
before the harp is out of the hand, he turns to the pencil! This
fault is almost inevitable; the reader, therefore, will see in the
first page of this Poem, that the graphic pencil is assumed, when
the tones of the harp were inappropriate.</p></blockquote>

<span class="i0">Slept in the solitary sunshine&mdash;there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bones that strew the inmost cavern lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when forgotten centuries had passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gray smoke went up from villages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cities, with their towers and temples, shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kingdoms rose and perished&mdash;there they lay!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The crow sailed o'er the spot; the villager<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><span class="i0">Plodded to morning toil, yet undisturbed<span class="linenum">49</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lay:&mdash;when, lo! as if but yesterday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Archangel's trump had thundered o'er the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty shade of ages that are passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towers into light! Say, Christian, is it true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dim recess, that cavern, heaped with bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will echo to thy Bible!<br /></span>
<span class="i9">But a while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here let me stand, and gaze upon the scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That headland, and those winding sands, and mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning sunshine, on that very shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once a child I wandered. Oh! return,<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I sigh) return a moment, days of youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of childhood,&mdash;oh, return! How vain the thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain as unmanly! yet the pensive Muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unblamed, may dally with imaginings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this wide view is like the scene of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once traversed o'er with carelessness and glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we look back upon the vale of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear remembered voices, and behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blended colours, images and shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long passed, now rising, as at Memory's call,<span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where stretches into mist the Severn sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, mingled with the clouds, old Cambria draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its stealing line of mountains, lost in haze;<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">In tempest to this height, to bury here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh-weltering carcases!<br /></span>
<span class="i9">But, lo, the Cave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descend the steps, cut rudely in the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cautious. The yawning vault is at our feet!<span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long caverns, winding within caverns, spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either side their labyrinths; all dark,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The structure, when no human voice was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all this isle; look upward to the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That silent drips, and has for ages dripped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which, like icicles, the stalactites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depend: then ask of the geologist,<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How nature, vaulting the rude chamber, scooped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its vast recesses; he with learning vast<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With sounds almost as craggy as the rock<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The very candle, as with sympathy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flares while he speaks, in glimmering wonderment!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But who can mark these visible remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor pause to think how awful, and how true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dread event they speak! What monuments<span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath man, since then, the lord, the emmet, raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On earth! He hath built pyramids, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand there! and in their solitude they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst, like the camel's shadow on the sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath them years and ages passed. He said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name shall never die! and like the God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silence,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> with his finger on his lip,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pale in the morning sun! Ambition sighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment, and passed on. In this rude isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Druid altars frowned; and still they stand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wave, and the trumpets sounding to advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shields, and helms, and crests, and chariots, mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious march of Cæsar's soldiery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firing the gray horizon! They are passed!<span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a gleam of glory, perishing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave but a name behind! So passes man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An armed spectre o'er a field of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vanishes; and other armed shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass by, red battle hurtling as they pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saxon kings have strewed their palaces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Thames to Tyne. But, lo! the sceptre shakes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dane, remorseless as the hurricane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweeps his native cliffs, harries the land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What terror strode before his track of blood!<span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hamlets mourned his desultory march,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on the circling hills, along the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beacon-flame shone nightly! He has passed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now frowns the Norman victor on his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every cottage shrouds its lonely fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sad curfew sounds. Yet Piety,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With new-inspiring energies, awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ampler polity: in woody vales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In unfrequented wilds, and forest-glens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The towers of the sequestered abbey shone,<span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the pinnacles of Glaston-Fane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First met the morning light. The parish church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then too, exulting o'er the ruder cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upsprung, till soon the distant village peal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flings out its music, where the tapering spire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adds a new picture to the sheltered vale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uphill, thy rock, where sits the lonely church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the sands, seems like the chronicler<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of other times, there left to tell the tale!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="i1">But issuing from the cave, look round, behold<span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How proudly the majestic Severn rides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to the sea; how gloriously in light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rides! Along this solitary ridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where smiles, but rare, the blue campanula,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the thistles and gray stones that peep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the thin herbage, to the highest point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of elevation, o'er the vale below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow let us climb. First look upon that flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lowly heath-bell, smiling at our feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How beautiful it smiles alone! The Power<span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bade the great sea roar, that spread the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That called the sun from darkness, decked that flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade it grace this bleak and barren hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagination, in her playful mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might liken it to a poor village maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lowly, but smiling in her lowliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dressed so neatly as if every day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were Sunday. And some melancholy bard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might, idly musing, thus discourse to it:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of Summer, who dost linger here,<span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decking the thistly turf, and arid hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, let the majestic dahlia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glitter, an empress, in her blazonry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty; let the stately lily shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As snow-white as the breast of the proud swan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailing upon the blue lake silently,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lifts her tall neck higher as she views<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her shadow in the stream! Such ladies bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May reign unrivalled in their proud parterres!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wouldst not live with them; but if a voice,<span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancy, in shaping mood, might give to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the forsaken primrose thou wouldst say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, live with me, and we two will rejoice:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor want I company; for when the sea<span class="linenum">214</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines in the silent moonlight, elves and fays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gentle and delicate as Ariel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That do their spiritings on these wild holts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circle me in their dance, and sing such songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As human ear ne'er heard! But cease the strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest wisdom and severer truth should chide.<span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Behind that windmill, sailing round and round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like days on days revolving, Bleadon lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where first I pondered on the grammar-lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad as the spelling-book, beneath the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its secluded parsonage; Brean Down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emerges o'er the edge of Hutton Hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just seen in paler light! And Weston there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I remember a few cottages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprinkling the sand, uplifts its tower, and shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if in conscious beauty, o'er the scene.<span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have seen a far more welcome sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living line of population stream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children, and village maids, and gray old men&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stream o'er the sands to church: such change has been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the brief compass of one hastening life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet that hill, the light, is to my eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar as those sister isles that sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the mid channel! Look, how calm they sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As listening each to the tide's rocking roar!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of different aspects&mdash;this, abrupt and high,<span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And desolate, and cold, and bleak, uplifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its barren brow&mdash;barren, but on its steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One native flower is seen, the peony;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One flower, which smiles in sunshine or in storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sits companionless, but yet not sad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has no sister of the summer-field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None to rejoice with her when spring returns,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="i0">None that, in sympathy, may bend its head,<span class="linenum">248</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When evening winds blow hollow o'er the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In autumn's gloom! So Virtue, a fair flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blooms on the rock of Care, and, though unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So smiles in cold seclusion; while, remote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the world's flaunting fellowship, it wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like hermit Piety, one smile of peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sickness or in health, in joy or tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summer days or cold adversity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still it feels Heaven's breath, reviving, steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On its lone breast; feels the warm blessedness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Heaven's own light about it, though its leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are wet with evening tears!<span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i12">Yonder island<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems not so desolate, nor frowns aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if from human kind. The lighthouse there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the long winter night, shows its pale fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three forgotten mounds mark the rude graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None knows of whom; but those of men who breathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore their part in life, and looked to Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As man looks now!&mdash;they died and left no name!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancy might think, amid the wilderness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waves, they sought to hide from human eyes<span class="linenum">270</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All memory of their fortunes. Till the trump<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of doom, they rest unknown. But mark that hill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Kewstoke seems to creep into the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy abbey, Woodspring, rose.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Wild is the spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there three mailed murderers retired,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><span class="i0">To the last point of land. There they retired,<span class="linenum">276</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there they knelt upon the ground, and cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bury us 'mid the waves, where none may know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whispered secret of a deed of blood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stone is o'er those graves:&mdash;the sullen tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it flows by and sounds along the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems moaningly to say, Pray for our souls!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor other "Miserere" have they had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At eve, nor other orison at morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou hast put on thy mildest look to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mighty element! Solemn, and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And motionless, and touched with softer light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without noise, lies all thy long expanse.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon thy margin, watching one by one<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Might mar thy placidness!<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Oh, treachery!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So still, and like a giant in his strength<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And thought how he had blessed them in their sleep,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Snatched by the circling surge, and seen no more;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><span class="i0">While morning shone, and not a ripple told<span class="linenum">307</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How terrible and dark a deed was done!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And so the seas were hushed, and not a cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marred the pale moonlight, save that, here and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering far off, some feathery shreds were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sole orb, above the lighthouse, held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its course in loveliness; and not a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from the distant deep, save that, at times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the noise of human merriment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ear might seem to catch a low faint moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boding sound, as of a dying dirge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sunk rocks;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> while all was still beside,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the gay packet-bark, to Erin bound,<span class="linenum">320</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resounding with the laugh and song, went on!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look! she is gone! O God! she is gone down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her light-hearted company; gone down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once is still, save, on the mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just peering o'er the waters, the wild shrieks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of three, at times, are heard! They, when the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were round them, floating on the moonlight wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept there their dismal watch till morning dawned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the living world were then restored!<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A shower, even while we gaze, steals o'er the scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrouding it, and the sea-view is shout out,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the great sea. 'Twas night, and journeying far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We were belated on our road, 'mid scenes<span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">New and unknown,&mdash;a mother and her child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now first in this wide world a wanderer:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father came, the pastor of the church<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crowns the high hill crest, above the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, as the wheels went slow, and the still night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed listening, a low murmur met the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not of the winds:&mdash;my mother softly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen! it is the sea! With breathless awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the sound, and closer pressed her hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Much of the sea, in infant wonderment,<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I oft had heard, and of the shipwrecked man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sees, on some lone isle, day after day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun sink o'er the solitude of waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Crusoe; and the tears would start afresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er my mother kissed my cheek, and told<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><span class="i0">The story of that desolate wild man,<span class="linenum">26</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the speaking bird, when he returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After long absence to his cave forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, as in tones of human sympathy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Robin Crusoe!<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Thoughts like these arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first I heard, at night, the distant sound,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the white parsonage, among the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peeped out, that night I restless passed. The sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled all my thoughts; and when slow morning came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first sunbeam streaked the window-pane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rose unnoticed, and with stealthy pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straggling along the village green, explored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone my fearful but adventurous way;<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, having turned the hedgerow, I beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first time, thy glorious element,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Ocean, glittering in the beams of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretching far off, and, westward, without bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid thy sole dominion, rocking loud!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shivering I stood, and tearful; and even now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When gathering years have marked my look,&mdash;even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel the deep impression of that hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As but of yesterday!<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Spirit of Time,<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment pause, and I will speak to thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark clouds are round thee; but, lo! Memory waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wand,&mdash;the clouds disperse, as the gray rack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disperses while we gaze, and light steals out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the gaunt phantom almost seems to drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His scythe! Now shadows of the past, distinct,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are thronging round; the voices of the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are heard; and, lo! the very smoke goes up&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sighs o'er his solemn task&mdash;the spelling-book&mdash;<span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half moody, half in tears. Some lines of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are on that matron's brow; yet placidness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as resigned religion gives, is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled with sadness; for who e'er beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without one stealing sigh, a progeny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of infants clustering round maternal knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor felt some boding fears, how they might fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the wide world, when they who loved them most<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He, who o'erlooks yon sturdy labourer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delving the glebe! My father as he lived!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That father, and that mother, "earth to earth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose future fate they pondered with a sigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Long, nor unprosperous, has been his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through life's tumultuous scenes, who, when a child,<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Played in that garden platform in the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or loitered o'er the common, and pursued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The colts among the sand-hills; or, intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On hardier enterprise, his pumpkin-ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New-rigged, and buoyant, with its tiny sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Launched on the garden pond; or stretched his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once forgetting all this glorious toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the bright butterfly came wandering by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never will that day pass from his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, scarcely breathing for delight, at Wells,<span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the horsemen of the clock<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> ride round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if for life; and ancient Blandifer,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seated aloft, like Hermes, in his chair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complacent as when first he took his seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some hundred years ago; saw him lift up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if old Time was cowering at his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solemn lift up his mace, and strike the bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself for ever silent in his seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How little thought I then, the hour would come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the loved prelate of that beauteous fane,<span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At whose command I write, might placidly<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><span class="i0">Smile on this picture, in my future verse,<span class="linenum">122</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Blandifer had struck so many hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me, his poet, in this vale of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself unchanged and solemn as of yore!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My father was the pastor, and the friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all who, living then&mdash;the scene is closed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now silent in that rocky churchyard sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aged and the young! A village then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not as villages are now. The hind,<span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who delved, or "jocund drove his team a-field,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had then an independence in his look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heart; and, plodding on his lowly path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdained a parish dole, content, though poor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was the village monitor: he taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His children to be good, and read their book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the gallery took his Sunday place,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, with the bee, to work.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">So passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His days of cheerful, independent toil;<span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the pastor came that way, at eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a ready present for the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who read his book the best; and that poor child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered it, when, treading the same path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which his father trod, he so grew up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contented, till old Time had blanched his locks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he was borne&mdash;whilst the bell tolled&mdash;to sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same churchyard where his father slept!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter walked content, and innocent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As lovely, in her lowly path. She turned<span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hour-glass, while the humming wheel went round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or went "a-Maying" o'er the fields in spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leading her little brother by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the village lane, and o'er the stile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather cowslips; and then home again,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To turn her wheel, contented, through the day.<span class="linenum">156</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, singing low, bend where her brother slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rocking the cradle, to "sweet William's grave!"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No lure could tempt her from the woodbine shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she grew up, and folded first her hands<span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In infant prayer: yet oft a tear would steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down her young cheek, to think how desolate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That home would be when her poor mother died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still praying that she ne'er might cause a pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undutiful, to "bring down her gray hairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sorrow to the grave!"<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Now mark this scene!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fuming factory's polluted air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has stained the country! See that rural nymph,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An infant in her arms! She claims the dole<span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the cold parish, which her faithless swain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denies: he stands aloof, with clownish leer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The constable behind&mdash;and mark his brow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beckons the nimble clerk; the justice, grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns from his book a moment, with a look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pity, signs the warrant for her pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weekly eighteen pence; she, unabashed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slides from the room, and not a transient blush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far less the accusing tear, is on her cheek!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A different scene comes next: That village maid<span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approaches timidly, yet beautiful;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tear is on her lids, when she looks down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her sleeping child. Her heart was won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wedding-day was fixed, the ring was bought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the same story&mdash;Colin was untrue!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ruined, and then left her to her fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity her, she has not a friend on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that still tear speaks to all human hearts<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><span class="i0">But his, whose cruelty and treachery<span class="linenum">189</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caused it to flow! So crime still follows crime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask we the cause? See, where those engines heave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spread their giant arms o'er all the land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wheel is silent in the vale! Old age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And youth are levelled by one parish law!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask why that maid, all day, toils in the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Associate with the rude and ribald clown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in the shrinking April of her youth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To earn her loaf, and eat it by herself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parental love is smitten to the dust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over a little smoke the aged sire<span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds his pale hands&mdash;and the deserted hearth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is cheerless as his heart: but Piety<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Points to the Bible! Shut the book again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ranter is the roving gospel now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each his own apostle! Shut the book:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A locust-swarm of tracts darken its light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choke its utterance; while a Babel-rout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mock-religionists, turn where we will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have drowned the small still voice, till Piety,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick of the din, retires to pray alone.<span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">But though abused Religion, and the dole<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And withering life's green verdure underneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a poor and lowly flower of want<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has Education nursed, like a pure rill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winding through desert glens, and bade it live<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There was a village girl, I knew her well,<span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each with its little book; her lighted eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone beautiful where'er they turned; her form<span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was graceful; but her book her sole delight!<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instructed thus she went a serving-maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the neighbouring town,&mdash;ah! who shall guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A friendless maid, so beautiful and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From life's contagions! But she had been taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The duties of her humble lot, to pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God, and that one heavenly Father's eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was over rich and poor! On Sunday night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She read her Bible, turning still away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those who flocked, inflaming and inflamed,<span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To nightly meetings; but she never closed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Without a prayer to Him who "bade the sun<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No art, no bribe, could lure her steps astray<br /></span>

<h2>PART THIRD.</h2>

<h3>THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>I subjoin the plain narrative of the singular event on which this
tale is founded, from Mr Polwhele, that the reader may see how far,
<i>poetically</i>, I have departed from plain facts, and what I have
thought it best to add for the sake of moral, picturesque, and
poetical effect. The narrative is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"October, 1780. Thomas Thomas, aged 37. This man died of mental
anguish, or what is called a broken heart. He lived in the village
of Drannock, in the parish of Gwinnear, till an unhappy event
occurred, which proved fatal to his peace of mind for more than
eight years, and finally occasioned his death. He courted Elizabeth
Thomas, of the same village, who was his first-cousin; and it was
understood that they were under a matrimonial engagement. But in
May 1772, some little disagreement having happened between them,
he, out of resentment, or from some other motive, paid great
attention to another girl; and on Sunday the 31st of that month, in
the afternoon, accompanied her to the Methodist meeting at Wall.
During their absence, the slighted female, who was very beautiful
in her person, but of an extremely irritable temper, took a rope
and a common prayer-book, in which she had folded down the 109th
Psalm, and, going into an adjacent field, hanged herself. Thomas,
on his return from the preaching, inquired for Betsy; and being
told she had not been seen for two or three hours, he exclaimed,
'Good God! she has destroyed herself!' which apprehension seems to
show, either that she had threatened to commit suicide in
consequence of his desertion, or that he dreaded it from a
knowledge of the violence of her disposition. But when he saw that
his fears were realised, and had read the psalm, so full of
execrations, which she had pointed out to him, he cried out, 'I am
ruined for ever and ever!' The very sight of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> village and
neighbourhood was now become insupportable, and he went to live at
Marazion, hoping that a change of scene and social intercourse
might expel those excruciating reflections which harrowed up his
very soul, or at least render them less acute; but in this he
appeared to be mistaken, for he found himself closely pursued by
the evil demon</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Despair, whose torments no man, sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lovers and the damned endure.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"To hear the 109th Psalm would petrify him with horror, and
therefore he would not attend divine service on the 22d day of the
month; he dreaded to go near a reading school, lest he should hear
the dreaded lesson. Whatever misfortunes befel him (and these were
not a few, for he was several times hurt, and even maimed, in the
mines in which he laboured), he still attributed them all to the
malevolent agency of the deceased, and thought he could find
allusions to the whole in the calamitous legacy which she had
bequeathed him. When he slumbered, for he knew nothing of sound
sleep, the injured girl appeared to his imagination, with such a
countenance as she retained after the rash action, and the
prayer-book in her hand, open at the hateful psalm; and he was
frequently heard to cry out, 'Oh, my dear Betsy, shut the book,
shut the book!' <i>etc.</i> With a mind so disturbed and deranged,
though he could not reasonably expect much consolation from
matrimony, yet imagining that the cares of a family might distract
his thoughts from the miserable subject by which he was harassed
both by day and night, he successively paid his addresses to many
girls of Marazion; but they indignantly flew from him, and with a
sneer asked him, whether he was desirous of bringing all the curses
in the 109th Psalm on their heads? At length, however, he succeeded
with one who had less superstition and more fortitude than the
rest, and he led her to St Hilary church, to be married, January
21, 1778; but on the road thither, they were overtaken by a sudden
and violent hurricane, such as those which not unfrequently happen
in the vicinity of Mount's Bay; and he, suspecting that poor Betsy
rode the whirlwind and directed the storm, was convulsed with
terror, and was literally 'coupled with fear.' Such is the power of
conscious guilt to impute accidental occurrences to the hand of
vindictive justice, and so true is the observation of the poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Judicium metuit sibi mens <a name='TC3'></a><a name='TC_3'></a><ins title="Was 'mall'">mali</ins> conscia justum.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"He lived long enough to have a son and a daughter; but the
corrosive worm within his breast preyed upon his vitals, and at
length consumed all the powers of his body, as it had long before
destroyed the tranquillity of his mind, and he was released from
all his pangs, both mental and corporeal, on Friday, October 20,
1780, and buried at St Hilary, the Sunday following, during evening
service."</p></blockquote>

<span class="i0">The passing keel is scarcely heard to glide,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See where the spectre goes! with frenzied look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shrieks again, Oh! Mary, shut the book!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Now, to the ocean's verge the phantom flies,&mdash;<span class="linenum">404</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hark! far off, the lessening laughter dies.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Years passed away,&mdash;at night, or evening close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint, and more faint, the accusing spectre rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restored from toil and perils of the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now William treads his native place again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the Land's-end, upon the rudest shore,<span class="linenum">410</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, from the west, Atlantic surges roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lived, a lonely stranger, sad, but mild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All marked his sadness, chiefly when he smiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some competence he gained, by years of toil:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, in a cottage, on his native soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dwelt, remote from crowds, nor told his tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To human ear: he saw the white clouds sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft o'er the bay,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> when suns of summer shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still he wandered, muttering and alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night, when, like the tumult of the tide,<span class="linenum">420</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinking to sad repose, all trouble died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The book of God was on his pillow laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wept upon it, and in secret prayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He had no friend on earth, save one blue jay,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, from the Mississippi, far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the Atlantic, to his native land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brought;&mdash;and this poor bird fed from his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the great world there was not one beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom he cared, since his own mother died.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet manly strength was his, for twenty-years<span class="linenum">430</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weighed light upon his frame, though passed in tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His age not forty-two, and in his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of care more than of age appeared the trace.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mary was scarce remembered; by degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sights and sounds of life began to please.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span><span class="i1">Ruth was a widow, who, in youth, had known<span class="linenum">436</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griefs of the heart, and losses of her own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, patient, mild, compassionate, and kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First woke to human sympathies his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked affectionately, when her child<span class="linenum">440</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caressed his bird, and then he stood and smiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This widow and her child, almost unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived in a cottage that adjoined his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband was a fisher, one whose life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fraught with terror to an anxious wife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night after night exposed upon the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning, tired with toil, or drenched with rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gains, uncertain as his life; he knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stated hours of labour and repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When others to a cheerful home retire,<span class="linenum">450</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his wife sits before the evening fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, rocking in the dark, tempestuous night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply is thinking of that social light.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ruth's husband left the bay, the wind and rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down, the tempest swept the howling main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boat sank in the storm, and he was found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below the rocks of the dark Lizard, drowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Seven years had passed, and after evening prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To William's cottage Ruth would oft repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with her little son would sometimes stay,<span class="linenum">460</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening to tales of regions far away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondering boy loved of those scenes to hear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of battles&mdash;of the roving buccaneer&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wild hunters, in the forest-glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fires, and dances of the savage men.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So William spoke of perils he had passed,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of voices heard amid the roaring blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those who, lonely and of hope bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon some melancholy rock are left,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who mark, despairing, at the close of day,<span class="linenum">470</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, some far-off vessel sail away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke with pity of the land of slaves&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the phantom-ship that rides the waves.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It comes! it comes! A melancholy light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams from the prow upon the storm of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis here! 'tis there! In vain the billows roll;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It steers right on, but not a living soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there to guide its voyage through the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or spread the sails of that mysterious bark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke of vast sea-serpents, how they float<span class="linenum">480</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many a rood, or near some hurrying boat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift up their tall neck, with a hissing sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And questing turn their bloodshot eye-balls round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke of sea-maids, on the desert rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in the sun comb their green dripping locks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, heard at distance, in the parting ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the furthest promontory's bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aërial music swells and dies away!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One night they longer stayed the tale to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ruth that night "beguiled him of a tear,<span class="linenum">490</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er he told of the distressful stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which his youth suffered." Then, she pitying spoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from that night a softer feeling grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As calmer prospects rose within his view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why not, ere the long night of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slow descent of life together tread?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The day is fixed; William no more shall roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">William and Ruth shall have one heart&mdash;one home:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world shut out, both shall together pray:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both wait the evening of life's changeful day:<span class="linenum">500</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shall his anguish soothe, when he is wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shall be a father to her child.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span><span class="i1">Fair rose the morn&mdash;the summer air how bland!<span class="linenum">503</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue wave scarcely seems to touch the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again 'tis William's wedding-day! advance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lo! the church and blue slate of Penzance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their faith and troth is pledged, the rites are o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nuptial band winds slow along the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smiling boy beside. As thus they passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sudden blackness rushed the impetuous blast;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a><span class="linenum">510</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep thunder rolled in long portentous sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At distance: nearer now, it shakes the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, William sinks, with speechless dread oppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the forked flash seems darted at his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beating heart is heard,&mdash;blanched is his cheek,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A well-known voice seemed in the storm to speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aghast he cried again, with frantic look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By late remorse he died; for, from that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judgment on his head, he pined away,<span class="linenum">520</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon an outcast suicide he lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By the church-porch rests Mary of Guynear;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the first cuckoo startles the cold year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blue mint<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> on her grave more beauteous grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One small bird<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> seems to sing for her repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the Land's-end, so black and weather-beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lies, and the dark sea is at his feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou, who hast heard the tale of the sad maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, conscious guilt is the accusing shade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou hast loved some gentle maid and true,<span class="linenum">530</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose first affections never swerved from you;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><span class="i0">Leave her not&mdash;oh! for pity and for truth,<span class="linenum">532</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave her not, tearful in her days of youth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too late, the pang of vain remorse shall start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Conscience thus avenge&mdash;a broken heart!<br /></span>

<h3>WALK ABROAD&mdash;VIEWS AROUND, FROM THE SEVERN TO BRISTOL&mdash;WRINGTON&mdash;"AULD
ROBIN GRAY."</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The shower is past&mdash;the heath-bell, at our feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks up, as with a smile, though the cold dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs yet within its cup, like Pity's tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the eyelids of a village child!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark! where a light upon those far-off waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams, while the passing shower above our head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheds its last silent drops, amid the hues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the fast-fading rainbow,&mdash;such is life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us go forth, the redbreast is abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, dripping in the sunshine, sings again.<span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">No object on the wider sea-line meets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The straining vision, but one distant ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging, as motionless and still, far off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the pale haze, between the sea and sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seems the ship&mdash;the very ship I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In infancy, and in that very place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst I, and all around me, have grown old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since she was first descried; and there she sits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solitary thing of the wide main&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she sat years ago. Yet she moves on:&mdash;<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow all may be one waste of waves!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where is she bound? We know not; and no voice<span class="linenum">22</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will tell us where. Perhaps she beats her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow up the channel, after many years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning from some distant clime, or lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the Atlantic! Oh! what anxious eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Count every nearer surge that heaves around!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many anxious hearts this moment beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thronging thoughts of home, till those fixed eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intensely fixed upon these very hills,<span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are filled with tears! Perhaps she wanders on&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On&mdash;on&mdash;into the world of the vast sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to be lost: never, with homeward sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destined to greet these far-seen hills again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now fading into mist! So let her speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we will pray she may return in joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every storm is past! Such is this sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shows one wandering ship! How different smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-scenes of the south; and chiefly thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waters of loveliest Hampton, chiefly thine&mdash;<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I have passed the happiest hours of youth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waters of loveliest Hampton! Thy gray walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loop-hooled battlements, cast the same shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the light blue wave, as when of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath their arch, King Canute sat,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and chid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tide, that came regardless to his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand years ago. Oh! how unlike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon solitary sea, the summer shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, while a crowd of glancing vessels glide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled with the young and gay, and pennants wave,<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sails, at distance, beautifully swell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the light breeze, or pass, like butterflies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the smoking steamers. And, oh look!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look! what a fairy lady is that yacht<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><span class="i0">That turns the wooded point, and silently<span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streams up the sylvan Itchin; silently&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet as if she said, as she went on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who does not gaze at me!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Yon winding sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were solitary once, as the wide sea.<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such I remember them! No sound was heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save of the sea-gull warping on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or of the surge that broke along the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad as the seas; and can I e'er forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, once, a visitor from Oxenford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of Wintonian scholarship, a youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent, but yet light-hearted, deeming here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could have no companion fit for him&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So whispered youthful vanity&mdash;for him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Oxford<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> had distinguished,&mdash;can my heart<span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget when once, with thoughts like these, at morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wandered forth alone! The first ray shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the white sea-gull's wing, and gazing round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I listened to the tide's advancing roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, for the old and booted fisherman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who silent dredged for shrimps, in the cold haze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sunrise, I beheld&mdash;or was it not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A momentary vision?&mdash;a fair form&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A female, following, with light, airy step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wave as it retreated, and again<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tripping before it, till it touched her foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if in play; and she stood beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to a fairy sea-maid of the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Graceful, and young, and on the sands alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked that she would vanish! She had left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like me, just left the abode of discipline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came, in the gay fulness of her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><span class="i0">When the pale light first glanced along the wave,<span class="linenum">88</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play with the wild ocean, like a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though I knew her not, I vowed (oh, hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye votaries of German sentiment!)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vowed an eternal love; but, diffident,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cast a parting look, that seemed to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we ne'er meet again? The vision smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the scene to solitude. Once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We met, and then we parted, in this world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet no more; and that fair form, that shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision of a moment, on the sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never seen again! Now it has passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all things are forgotten; but it shone<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me a sparkle of the morning sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That trembled on the light wave yesterday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perished there for ever!<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Look around!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the winding reach of Severn stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With massy fragments of forsaken towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy castle, solitary Walton. Hark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the lone ivied arch, was it the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came fitful! There, by moonlight, we might stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deem it some old castle of romance;<span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the glimmering ledge of yonder rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the wave, fancy it was the form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a spectre-lady, for a moment seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting her bloody dagger, then with shrieks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanishing! Hush! there is no sound&mdash;no sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of the Severn sweeping onward! Look!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no bleeding apparition there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fiery phantoms glare along thy walls!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounded by the works of silent art,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><span class="i0">And far, far more endearing, by a group<span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>

only by a narrow shelf of rocks called Swallow-clift, William de
Courteneye, about 1210, founded a friary of Augustine monks at
Worsprynge, or Woodspring, to the honour of the Holy Trinity, the Virgin
Mary, and St Thomas à Becket. William de Courteneye was a descendant of
William de Traci, and was nearly related to the three other murderers of
à Becket, to whom this monastery was dedicated.</p></div>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<blockquote><p>The circumstance of the late critical controversy with Lord Byron
having recalled my attention to a poem, sketched some years ago, on
a subject of national history, I have been induced to revise and
correct, and now venture to offer it to the public.</p>

<p>The subject, though taken from an early period of our history, is,
so far as relates to the grave of Harold, purely imaginary, as are
all the characters, except those of the Conqueror, and of Edgar
Atheling. History, I think, justifies me in representing William as
acting constantly under strong religious impressions. A few
circumstances in his life will clearly show this. When Harold was
with him in Normandy, he took an oath of him on two altars, within
which were concealed miraculous relics.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> His banner was sent
from Rome, consecrated by the Pope, for the especial purpose of the
invasion of England. Without adverting to the night spent in prayer
before the battle of Hastings, was not this impression more
decidedly shown when he pitched his tent among the dead on that
night, and vowed to build an abbey on the spot? The event of the
battle was so much against all human probability, that his
undertaking it, at the place and time, can only be reconciled by
supposing that he acted under some extraordinary impression.</p>

<p>When the battle was gained, he knew not on what course to
determine: instead of marching to London, he retired towards Dover.
When he was met by the Kentish men, with green boughs, the quaint
historian says, "He was <i>daunted</i>." These and many other incidental
circumstances may occur to the reader.</p>

<p>In representing him, therefore, as under the control of
superstitious impressions, I trust I have not transgressed, at
least, poetical verisimilitude. An earthquake actually happened
about the period at which the poem commences, followed by storms
and inundations. Of these facts I have availed myself.</p>

<p>I fear the poem will be thought less interesting, from having
nothing of <i>love</i> in it, except, in accordance with the received
ideas of the gentleness of Atheling's character, I have made him
not insensible to one of my imaginary females; and have, therefore,
to mark his character, made him advert to the pastoral scenes of
Scotland, where he had been a resident. There is a similarity
between my "Monk," and "The Missionary," but their offices and the
scenes are entirely different, and some degree of resemblance was
unavoidable in characters of the same description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Filial affection, love of our country, bravery, sternness
(inflexible, except under religions fears); the loftier feelings of
a desolate female, under want and affliction, with something of the
wild prophetical cast; religious submission, and deep acquiescence
in the will of God;&mdash;these passions are brought into action, around
one centre, if I may use the word, <span class="smcap">The Grave of the last Saxon</span>.</p>

<p>That Harold's sons landed with a large fleet from Denmark, and were
joined by an immense confederate army, in the third year of
William's reign, is a well-known historical fact. That York was
taken by the confederate army, and that all the Normans, except Sir
William Malet, and his family, were killed, is also matter of
record.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> That afterwards, the blow against William failing, the
whole country, from the Humber to Tyne, from the east to the west,
was depopulated by sword and famine, are facts which are also to be
found in all historians.</p>

<p>Some slight anachronisms may I hope, be pardoned&mdash;if anachronisms
they are&mdash;such as the year in which the Tower was built, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p>The plan of the Poem will be found, I trust, simple and coherent,
the characters sufficiently marked and contrasted, and the whole
conducive, however deficient in other respects, to the excitement
of virtuous sympathy, and subservient to that which alone can give
dignity to poetry&mdash;the cause of moral and religious truth.</p></blockquote>

<span class="i0">They come not: Have they perished? So dark thoughts<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The old man's hand, and said, Yet we will die<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Firm and unfaltering, kissed the crucifix.<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They knelt together, and the old man spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All here is toil and tempest&mdash;we shall go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of Harold, where the weary rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! holy Mary, 'tis the clank of steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the stone stairs! and, lo! beneath the lamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arms, the beaver of his helmet raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some light hairs straying on his ruddy cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With breath hastily drawn, and cheering smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Atheling: The Saxon banner waves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! are my brothers safe? cried Adela,<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak! speak! oh! tell me, do my brothers live?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Atheling answered: They will soon appear;<span class="linenum">52</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My post was on the eastern hills, a scout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came breathless, sent from Edmund, and I hied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a small company, and horses fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his command, to thee. He bade me say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even now, upon the citadel of York,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the bursting fires, and rolling smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saxon banner waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">I thank thee, Lord!<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brothers live! cried Adela, and knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the platform, with uplifted hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look to heaven;&mdash;then rising, with a smile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have watched, I and this old man here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hour after hour, through the long lingering night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now 'tis almost morning: I will stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I have heard my brother's distant horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the west woods;&mdash;but you are weary, youth?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, no! I will keep watch with you till dawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me most soothing is an hour like this!<span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who that saw, as now, the morning stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin to pale, and the gray twilight steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So calmly on the seas, and wide-hushed world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could deem there was a sound of misery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On earth; nay, who could hear thy gentle voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair maid, and think there was a voice of hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or strife beneath the stillness of that cope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above us! Oh! I hate the noise of arms&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here will I watch with you. Then, after pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor England is not what it once has been;<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strange are both our fortunes.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Atheling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Adela answered) early piety<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How didst thou pass in safety from this land<span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slavery and sorrow?<br /></span>
<span class="i11">He replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When darker jealousy and lowering hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat on the brow of William, England mourned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one dark spirit of conspiracy<span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttered its curses through the land. 'Twas then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fiercer glare, the lion's eye was turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On me:&mdash;My sisters and myself embarked&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wide world was before us&mdash;we embarked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some few faithful friends, and from the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed tearful, for a moment, on the shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We left for ever (so it then appeared).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Margaret hid her face; but the fresh wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swelled the broad mainsail, and the lessening land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The towers, the spires, the villages, the smoke,<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were seen no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">When now at sea, the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blew adverse, for to Holland was our course:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fearful rose the storm; the east wind sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder, till wrecked upon the shores of Forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our vessel lay. Here, friendless, we implored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A short sojourn and succour. Scotland's king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sat in Dunfermline; he heard the tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our distress, and flew himself to save;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he saw my sister Margaret,<span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young, innocent, and beautiful in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart was moved.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Oh! welcome here, he cried:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If such a flower be cast to the bleak winds,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">King Malcolm left his land of hills; his arm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Even should we fail, my sister Margaret<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Oh! might I?) on the banks of Tay or Tweed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thee to wander, where no curfew sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mark the summer sun, beyond the hills,<span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sink in its glory, and then, hand in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wind through the woods, and&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Adela replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smile complacent, Listen; I will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So to beguile the creeping hours of time)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tale-teller. Two years we held sojourn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Denmark; two long weary years, and sighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, looking on the southern deep, we thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our poor country. Give me men and ships!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Godwin still cried; oh! give me men and ships!<span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king commanded, and his armament&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mightier never stemmed the Baltic deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent forth by sea-kings of the north, or bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On hardier enterprise; for not some isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the lone Orcades was now the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But England's throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">His mighty armament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now left the shores of Denmark. Our brave ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst through the Baltic straits, how gloriously!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the trumpets ring; I saw the sails<span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nigh three hundred war-ships, the dim verge<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of the remote horizon's skiey track<span class="linenum">152</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bestudding, here and there, like gems of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped from the radiance of the morning sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the gray waste of waters. So our ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept o'er the billows of the north, and steered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right on to England.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Foremost of the fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our gallant vessel rode; around the mast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emblazoned shields were ranged, and plumed crests<span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook as the north-east rose. Upon the prow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More ardent, Godwin, my brave brother, stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And milder Edmund, on whose mailed arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hung, when the white waves before us swelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And parted. The broad banner, in full length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streamed out its folds, on which the Saxon horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ramped, as impatient on the land to leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the winds still bore it bravely on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the red cross on the front banner shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hoar deep crimsoning.<span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i10">Winds, bear us on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear us as cheerily, till white Albion's cliffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resound to our triumphant shouts; till there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his own Tower, that frowns above the Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even there we plant these banners and this cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stamp the Conqueror and his crown to dust!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They would have kept me on a foreign shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But could I leave my brothers! I with them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew up, with them I left my native land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them all perils have I braved, of sea<span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or war, all storms of hard adversity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let death betide, I reck not; all I ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is yet once more, in this sad world, to kneel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my father's grave, and kiss the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the fourth morning gleamed along the deep,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<span class="i0">England, Old England! burst the general cry:<span class="linenum">186</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">England, Old England! Every eye, intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was turned; and Godwin pointed with his sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Flamborough, pale rising o'er the surge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer into the kingdom's heart bear on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The death-storm of our vengeance! Godwin cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon, like a cloud, the northern Foreland rose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know ye those cliffs, towering in giant state!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, hark! along the shores alarum-bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ring out more loud, blast answers blast, the swords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hurrying horsemen, and projected spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash to the sun. On yonder castle walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand bows are bent; again our course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the north is turned. Now twilight veiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sinking sands of Yarmouth, and we heard<span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long deep toll from many a village tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On shore&mdash;and, lo! the scattered inland lights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sprinkled winding ocean's lowly verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once are lost in darkness. God in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the curfew! Godwin cried, and smote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His forehead. We all heard that sullen sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first time, that night; but the winds blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our ship sailed out of hearing; yet we thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the poor mother, who, on winter nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When her belated husband from the wood<span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not come back, her lonely taper lit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned the glass, and saw the faggot-flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine on the faces of her little ones:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those times will ne'er return.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Darkness descends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the sun is rising o'er the waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now hoarse Humber roars beneath our keels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we have landed<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
<span class="i9">Yea, and struck a blow,<span class="linenum">219</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as may make the crowned Conqueror quail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Edgar replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Grant Heaven that we may live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adela cried, in love and peace again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every storm is past. But this good man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is silent. Ailric, does no hope, even now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise on thy dark heart? Good father, speak!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With aspect mild, on which its fitful light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watch-tower lamp threw pale, the monk replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Youth, on thy light hair and ingenuous brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most comely sits the morn of life; on me,<span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this bare head, the night of time descends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sorrow. I look back upon the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think of joy and sadness upon earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the vast ocean's fluctuating toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From everlasting! I have seen its waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in the sunshine sleeping; now high-ridged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With storms; and such the kingdoms of the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, youth, and flattering fortune, and the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of summer days, are as the radiance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flits along the solitary waves,<span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even whilst we gaze, and say, How beautiful!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fitful and so perishing the dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human things! But there is light above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undying; and, at times, faint harmonies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard, by the weary pilgrim, in his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er perilous rocks, and through unwatered wastes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who looks up, fainting, and prays earnestly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass into that rest, whence sounds so sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, whispering of hope; else it were best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the load the forlorn heart endures<span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sink at once; to shut the eyes on things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sear the sight; and so to wrap the soul<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In sullen, tearless, ruthless apathy!<span class="linenum">253</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, 'midst every human change, I drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tear upon the cross, and all is calm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, full of blissful and of brightest views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this dark tide of time.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Youth, thou hast known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adversity; even in thy morn of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The springtide rainbow fades, and many days,<span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many years, perchance, of weal or woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang o'er thee! happy, if through every change<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Oh! I remember when King Harold stood<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Your king hath met the meed of broken faith,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My purpose stands, as I have vowed to God,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">King William said. We crossed our breasts, and passed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sun rose on that still and dismal host;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toiling from corse to corse, we trod in blood,<span class="linenum">330</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">On many a face, ghastly upturned; her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unloosed the helmet, smoothed the clotted hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many livid hands she took in hers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, stooping o'er a mangled corse, she shrieked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then into tears burst audibly, and turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face, and with a faltering voice pronounced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, Harold! We took up, and bore the corse<span class="linenum">340</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our brethren met us, chanting, two and two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "Miserere" of the dead. And there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, my child Adela, you are in tears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There at the foot of the high altar lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last of Saxon kings. Sad Editha,<span class="linenum">360</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At distance, watched the rites, and from that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We never saw her more.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">A distant trump<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rung&mdash;again!&mdash;again!&mdash;and thrice a trump<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has answered from the walls of Ravenspur.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brothers! they are here! Adela cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the tower in breathless ardour. York<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flames to the sky! a general voice was heard&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drawbridge clanks; into the inner court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mailed man rides on&mdash;York is no more!<span class="linenum">370</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cry without redoubles. On the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rider flung his bloody sword, and raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His helm, dismounting: the first dawn of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed on the shattered plume. Oh! Adela,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried, your brother Godwin! and she flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And murmuring, My brave brother! hid her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping his mailed breast. Soon gazing round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cried, But where is Edmund? Was he wont<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To linger?<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Edmund has a sacred charge,<span class="linenum">380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Godwin replied. But trust his anxious love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We soon shall hear his voice. I need some rest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis now broad day; but we have watched and fought:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I can sleep sound, though the shrill bird of morn<span class="linenum">384</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mount and upbraid my slumbers with her song.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tranquil and clear the autumnal day declined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The barks at anchor cast their lengthened shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the gray bastioned walls; airs from the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandered, and touched the cordage as they passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hovered with expiring breath, and stirred<span class="linenum">390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce the quiescent pennant; the bright sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay silent in its glorious amplitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without; far up, in the pale atmosphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white cloud, here and there, hung overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some red freckles streaked the horizon's edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far as the sight could reach; beneath the rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That reared their dark brows beetling o'er the bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gulls and guillemots, with short quaint cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just broke the sleeping stillness of the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, skimming, almost touched the level main,<span class="linenum">400</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wings far seen, and more intensely white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opposed to the blue space; whilst Panope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Played in the offing. Humber's ocean-stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inland, went sounding on, by rocks and sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And castle, yet so sounding as it seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice amidst the hushed and listening world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spoke of peace; whilst from the bastion's point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One piping red-breast might almost be heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such quiet all things hushed, so peaceable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hour: the very swallows, ere they leave<span class="linenum">410</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coast to pass a long and weary way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er ocean's solitude, seem to renew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more their summer feelings, as a light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet would last for ever, whilst they flock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the brief sunshine of the turret-top.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Twas at this hour of evening, Adela<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Godwin, now restored by rest, went forth,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Linked arm in arm, upon the eastern beach,<span class="linenum">418</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the headland's shade. If such an hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed smiling on the heart, how smiled it now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him who yesternight, a soldier, stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the direst sight of human strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bloodshed; heard the cries, the trumpet's blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ring o'er the dying; saw, with all its towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city blazing to the midnight sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mangled groups of miserable men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gasping or dead, whilst with his iron heel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He splashed the blood beneath! How changed the scene!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun's last light upon the battlements,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea, the landscape, the peace-breathing air,<span class="linenum">430</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered both of the departed hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of early life, when once they had a home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A country, where their father wore a crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What changes since that time, for them and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They loved! how many found an early grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut off by the red sword! how many mourned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered by various fates, through distant lands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How desolate their own poor country, bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the oppressor's chain! As thoughts like these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose, the bells of rural Nevilthorpe<span class="linenum">440</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang out a joyous peal, rang merrily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For tidings heard from York: their melody<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled with things forgotten. Until then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then remembered freshly, Adela<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That instant turned to hide her tears, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brother Edmund leading by the hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boy of lovely mien and footstep light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the sands. My sister, Edmund cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See here a footpage I have brought from York<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve a lady fair! The boy held out<span class="linenum">450</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand to Adela, as he would say,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Look, and protect me, lady. Adela,<span class="linenum">452</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing with a smile and glowing cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, Welcome, truant brother; and then took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child's right hand, and said, My pretty page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have you not a tale to tell to me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy spake nothing, but looked earnestly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anxiously at Edmund. Edmund said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he is silent, I must speak for him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas when the minster flamed, and, sword in hand,<span class="linenum">460</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Godwin, and Waltheof, and stern Hereward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Directed the red slaughter; black with smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I burst into the citadel, and saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the grim warder, with his huge axe up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But o'er her child, a frantic mother, mute<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horror, in delirious agony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping it to her bosom; stern and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father stood, his hand upon his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As praying, in that hour, that God might make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mercy, the last trial brief. Fear not&mdash;<span class="linenum">470</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a man&mdash;nay, fear not me, I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seizing this child's hand, in safety placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the smoke, and sounds and sights of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him and his mother! She with bursting heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knelt down to bless me: when I saw that boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So beautiful, I thought of Adela,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, Oh! trust with his preserver him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom every eye must view with tender love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! trust me; for his safety, lo! I pledge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My honour and my life.<span class="linenum">480</span><br /></span>
<span class="i8">And I have brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My trusted charge, that you, my Adela,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May show him gentler courtesy than those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom war in its stern trade has almost steeled.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><span class="i0">His sister kissed the child's light hair and cheek,<span class="linenum">485</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folded his small hands in hers, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall be my true knight, and wear a plume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou not, boy; and for a lady's love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fight, like a valiant soldier! I will die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor child said, for friends like those who saved<span class="linenum">490</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father and my mother; and again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adela kissed his forehead and his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, But we are Saxons!<br /></span>
<span class="i11">As she spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds began to muster, and the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swelled with a sound more solemn, whilst the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sinking, and its last and lurid light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streaked the long line of cumbrous clouds, that hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wild red masses o'er the murmuring deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now flickering fast with foam. The sea-fowl flew<span class="linenum">500</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapidly on, o'er the black-lifted surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne down the wind, and then was seen no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the dark deep wilder heaves, and, hark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavily overhead the gathered storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes sounding!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Haste!&mdash;and in the castle-keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">List to the winds and waves that roar without.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">That night, King William first within the Tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received his vassal barons; in that Tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which oft since then has echoed to night-shrieks<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of secret murder, or the lone lament.<span class="linenum">46</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now other sounds were heard, for on this night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its canopied and vaulted chambers rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With minstrelsy; whilst sounds of long acclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-echoed, from the loopholes, o'er the Thames<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drawbridge, and the ponderous cullis-gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frowned on the moat; the flanking towers aspired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the embattled walls, where proudly waved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Norman banner. William, laugh to scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murmurs of conspiracy and hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That round thee gather, like the storms of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mustering, when murder hides her visored mien!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, what hast thou to fear! Let the fierce Dane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the centre of thy kingdom sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hostile armament, even like the tide<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hoarse Humber, on whose waves he rode!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let foes confederate; let one voice of hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One cry of instant vengeance, one deep curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be heard, from Waltham woods to Holderness!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Waltheof, stern in steel; let Hereward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient as undaunted, flash their swords;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the boy Edgar, backed by Scotland's king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advance his feeble claim, and don his casque,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose brows might better a blue bonnet grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Edwin and vindictive Morcar join<span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of Harold,&mdash;what hast thou to fear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">London's sole Tower might laugh their strength to scorn!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon that night when York's proud castle fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here William held his court. The torches glared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On crest and crozier. Knights and prelates bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their sovereign. He, his knights and peers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surveying with a stern complacency,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inclined not from his seat, o'ercanopied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With golden valance, woven by no hand,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Save of the Queen. Yet calm his countenance<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone, and his brow a dignified repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marked kingly; high his forehead, and besprent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dark hair, interspersed with gray; his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glanced amiable, chiefly when the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a brief smile attempered majesty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beard was dark and heavy, yet diffused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low as the lion ramping on his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engrailed upon the mail.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Odo approached,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knelt, then rising, placed the diadem<span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his brow, with laurels intertwined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the voice of acclamation rang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the galleries a hundred harps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resounded Roland's song! Long live the King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The barons, and the prelates, and the knights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long live the Conqueror! cried; a god on earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That instant the high vaulted chamber shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with a blast from heaven, and all was mute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around him, and the very fortress rocked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it would topple on their heads. He rose<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturbed and frowning, for tumultuous thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowded like night upon his heart; then waved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand. The barons, abbots, knights retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold him now alone! before a lamp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crucifix appears; upon the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies the same sword that Hastings' battle dyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep to the hilt in gore; behold, he kneels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prays, Thou only, Lord, art ever great;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have mercy on my sins! The crucifix<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook as he spoke, shook visibly, and, hark!<span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a low moan, as of dying men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At distance heard.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="i7">Then William first knew fear.<span class="linenum">113</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had heard tumults of the battle-field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise, the glorious hurrahs, and the clang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of trumpets round him, but no sound like this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere smote with unknown terror on his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the eye of God that moment turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw it beating.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Rising slow, he flung<span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a couch his agitated limbs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lamp was near him; on the ground his sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And helmet lay; short troubled slumbers stole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darkly rose the spirit of his dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He saw a field of blood,&mdash;it passed away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glittering palace rose, with mailed men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thronged, and the voice of multitudes was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acclaiming: suddenly the sounds had ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering palace vanished, and, behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long winding cloisters, echoing to the chant<span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stoled fathers; and the mass-song ceased&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a dark tomb appeared, and, lo! a shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of a phantom-king!<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Nearer it came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nearer yet, in silence, through the gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing&mdash;still advancing: the cold glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of armour shone as it approached, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stands o'er William's couch! The spectre gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A while, then lifting its dark visor up&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Aloud the harpers strike their harps, whilst morning light is flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the cross-bows and the shields, that round the masts are hung.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fleet sailed on, till, Pevensey! we saw thy welcome strand;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now front to front they stand, in still and terrible array.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give out the word, God, and our right! rush like a storm along,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fatal shaft has sped,&mdash;by Heaven! it hisses in his brain!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The knight replied: conspiracy and fraud<span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">I reck it not: what is to me the night,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The woman said. Again the clarions rung:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He, ere he vaulted to the saddle-bow,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><span class="i0">The voice of fame will bruit it far and wide,<span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Harold's children fled with thee, and sought<span class="linenum">141</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A refuge in thy kingdom. None will know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our destination. In thy boat conveyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may be landed near the rocky cave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boat again ply to thy ships, and they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plough homeward the north seas, whilst we are left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fate. Again the pilot's voice was heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, o'er the sand-hills, an approaching file<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Norman soldiers, with projected spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already seemed as rushing on their prey.<span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Ailric took the hand of Adela;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She and her brothers, and young Atheling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Scotland's king, are in one boat embarked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the sun sets red, and twilight shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sinking hills. The solitary boat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has reached the adverse shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Here, then, we part!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Malcolm said; and every voice replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God speed brave Malcolm to his father's land!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ailric, the brothers, and their sister, left<span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boat; they stood upon the moonlit beach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still listening to the sounds, as they grew faint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the receding oars, and watching still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If one white streak at distance, as they dipped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were seen, till all was solitude around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive, they sought a refuge for that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bleak ocean-cave. The morning dawns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brothers have put off the plumes of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropping one tear upon the sword. Disguised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In garb to suit their fortunes, they appear<span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like shipwrecked seamen of Armorica,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a Franciscan hermit through the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led to St Alban's shrine, to offer vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vows to the God who heard them in that hour<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When all beside had perished in the storm.<span class="linenum">175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrecked near his ocean-cave, an eremite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So went the tale of their disastrous fate)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustained them, and now guides them through a land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of strangers. That fair boy was wont to sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the mast, when the still ship went slow<span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the seas, in sunshine; and that garb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conceals the lovely, light-haired Adela.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cuckoo's note in the deep woods was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When forth, they fared. At many a convent gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stood and prayed for shelter, and their pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hastened, if, high amid the clouds, they marked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some solitary castle lift its brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray in the distance&mdash;hastened, so to reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere it grew dark, its hospitable towers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the lithe minstrel sung his roundelay:<span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">When tired, at noon, by the white waterfall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some romantic and secluded glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sat, and heard the blackbird overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing, unseen, a song, such as they heard<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In infancy.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> So every vernal morn<span class="linenum">207</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought with it scents of flowers, or songs of birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled with many shapings of old things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And days gone by. Then up again, to scale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The airy mountain, and behold the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretching below, and fading far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How beautiful; yet still to feel a tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starting, even when it shone most beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think, Here, in the country of our birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No rest is ours!<br /></span>
<span class="i7">On, to our father's grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So southward through the country they had passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now many days, and casual shelter found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In villages, or hermit's lonely cave,<span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or castle, high embattled on the point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some steep mountain, or in convent walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For most with pity heard his song, and marked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The countenance of the wayfaring boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when the pale monk, with his folded hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his breast, prayed, For the love of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity the poor, give alms; and bade them speed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, in distant light, the pinnacles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a gray fane appeared, whilst on the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still evening shed its parting light. Oh, say,<span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, villager, what towers are those that rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eastward beyond the alders?<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Know ye not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answered, Waltham Abbey? Harold there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is buried&mdash;he who in the fight was slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Hastings! To the cheek of Adela<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deadly paleness came. On&mdash;let us on!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faintly she cried, and held her brother's arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hid her face a moment with her hand.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span><span class="i0">And now the massy portal's sculptured arch<span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before them rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Say, porter, Ailric cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor mariners, wrecked on the northern shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask charity. Does aged Osgood live?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell him a poor Franciscan, wandering far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wearied, for the love of God would ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His charity.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Osgood came slowly forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light that touched the western turret fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his pale face. The pilgrim-father said:<span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am your brother Ailric&mdash;look on me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these are Harold's children!<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Whilst he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Godwin, advancing, with emotion cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are his children! I am Godwin, this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Edmund, and, lo! poor and in disguise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our sister! We would kneel upon his grave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our father's!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Come yet nearer, Osgood said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nearer! and that instant Adela<span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked up, and wiping from her eyes a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you forgotten Adela?<br /></span>
<span class="i12">O God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man trembling cried, ye are indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our benefactor's children! Adela,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Edmund, brave Godwin! welcome to these walls&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome, my old companion! and he fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the neck of Ailric, and both wept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Osgood: Children of that honoured lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave us all, go near and bless his grave.<span class="linenum">270</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One parting sunbeam yet upon the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rested&mdash;it passed away, and darker gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gathering in the aisles. Each footstep's sound<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Was more distinctly heard, for all beside<span class="linenum">274</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was silent. Slow along the glimmering fane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They passed, like shadows risen from the tombs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The entrance-door was closed, lest aught intrude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the sanctity of this sad hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inner choir they enter, part in shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And part in light, for now the rising moon<span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to glance upon the shrines, and tombs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pillars. Trembling through the windows high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One beam, a moment, on that cold gray stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is flung&mdash;the word "Infelix"<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> is scarce seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold his gravestone! Osgood said. Each eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was turned. A while intent they gazed, then knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the altar, on the marble stone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound was heard through all the dim expanse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the vast building, none but of the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came in dying echoes up the aisle,<span class="linenum">290</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like whispers heard at the confessional.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Harold's children, hand in hand, knelt down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon their father's grave knelt down, and prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have mercy on his soul&mdash;have mercy, Lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They knelt a lengthened space, and bowed their heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some natural tears they shed, and crossed their breasts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rising slowly up, looked round, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monk approaching near, unmarked before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the further distance the tall form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of a female. He who wore the hood<span class="linenum">300</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And habit of a monk approached and spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers! beloved sister! know ye not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These features?&mdash;and he raised his hood&mdash;Behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me&mdash;me, your brother Marcus! whom these weeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since last we met, have hidden from the world:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me kneel with you here!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<span class="i14">When Adela<span class="linenum">407</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld him, she exclaimed, Oh! do we meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, my lost brother, o'er a father's grave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You live, restored a moment in this world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To us as from the grave! And Godwin took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand, and said, My brother, tell us all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How have you lived unknown? Oh! tell us all!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When in that grave our father, he replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was laid, ye fled, and I in this sad land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remained to cope with fortune. To these walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came, when Ailric, from his vows absolved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you was wandering. None my lineage knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or name, but I some time had won regard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the superior. Osgood knew me not,<span class="linenum">420</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with Earl Edwin I had lived from youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To our superior thus I knelt and prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir, I beseech you, for the love of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of our Lady Mary, and St John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would receive me here to live and die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among you. What most moved my heart to take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vows was this, that here, from day to day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From year to year, within the walls he raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might behold my father's grave. This eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat in the confessional, unseen,<span class="linenum">430</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you approached. I scarce restrained the tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From many recollections, when I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tale of sorrow and of sin. Come near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woman of woe!&mdash;and a wan woman stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before them, tall and stately; her dark eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone, as the uncertain lamp cast a brief glare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed her neck, and raven hair, and lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving. She spoke not, but advanced and knelt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, too&mdash;on Harold's grave; then prayed aloud,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O God, be merciful to him&mdash;and me!<span class="linenum">440</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who art thou? Godwin cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Ah! know ye not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretched Editha? No children's love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could equal mine! I trod among the dead&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I not, fathers?&mdash;trod among the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From corse to corse, or saw men's dying eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed upon mine, and heard such groans as yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rive, with remembrance, my torn heart: I found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him who rests here, where then he lay in blood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he was buried, I beheld the rites<span class="linenum">450</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At distance, and with broken heart retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the wild woods; there I have lived unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that sad hour. Late when the tempest rocked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At midnight, a proud soldier shelter sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my lone cell; 'twas when the storm was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the deep forest, and he too had knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Harold's grave! Who was it? He! the king!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, fathers, was it not the hand of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That led his footsteps there!&mdash;but has he learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humility? Oh! ask this bleeding land!<span class="linenum">460</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last night a phantom came to me in dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a voice said, Come, visit my cold grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came, by some mysterious impulse led;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the even song, and when the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had ceased, and all departed, save one monk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stood and gazed upon this grave alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I prayed that he would hear me, at this hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confess my secret sins, for my full heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was labouring. It was Harold's son who sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the confessional, to me unknown;<span class="linenum">470</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all is now revealed&mdash;and lo! I stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before you!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
<span class="i7">As she spoke, a thrilling awe<span class="linenum">473</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to each heart: loftier she seemed to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dim moonlight; sorrowful, yet stern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her aspect; and her breast was seen to beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes were fixed, and shone with fearful light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She raised her right hand, and her dark hair fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her neck, whilst all, scarce breathing, heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit labours! she exclaimed. This night!<span class="linenum">480</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tomb! the altar! Ha! the vision strains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My senses to oppression! Marked ye not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trodden throne restored&mdash;the Saxon line<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of England's monarchs bursting through the gloom?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady, I look on thee! In distant years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even from the Northern throne which thou shalt share,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior-monarch shall arise, whose arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In concert with this country, now bowed low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall tear the eagle from a conqueror's grasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far greater than this Norman!<span class="linenum">490</span><br /></span>
<span class="i10">Spare, O God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My burning brain! Then, with a shriek, she fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insensible, upon the Saxon's grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bore her from the fane; and Godwin said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace, peace be with her, now and evermore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, taking Marcus by the hand, Yet here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt behold, behold from day to day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This honoured grave! But where in the great world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be thy place of rest, poor Adela?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O God, be ever with her! Marcus cried,<span class="linenum">500</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her, and you, my brothers! Here we part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to meet again. Whate'er your fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall remember with a brother's love,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><span class="i0">And pray for you; but all my spirit rests<span class="linenum">504</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In other worlds&mdash;in worlds, oh! not like this!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye may return to this sad scene when I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am dust and ashes; ye may yet return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And visit this sad spot; perhaps when age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or grief has brought such change of heart as now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel, then shall you look upon my grave,<span class="linenum">510</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shed one tear for him whose latest prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be: Oh, bless you! bless my sister, Lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Adela, with lifted look composed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, it is performed,&mdash;the duty vowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we returned to this devoted land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last sad duty of a daughter's love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I go in peace&mdash;go to a world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sorrow, conscious that a father's voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaks to my soul, and that thine eye, O God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er the fortunes of our future days,<span class="linenum">520</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is o'er us. Thou, direct our onward road!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the last Saxon's grave, old Osgood raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands and prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Father of heaven and earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is beneath Thine eye! 'Tis ours to bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence. Children of misfortune, loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revered&mdash;children of him who raised these roofs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No home is found for you in this sad land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none, perhaps, may know the spot, or shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tear upon the earth where ye are laid!<span class="linenum">530</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So saying, on their heads he placed his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blessed them all; but, after pause, rejoined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis dangerous lingering here&mdash;the fire-eyed lynx<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would lap your blood! Westward, beyond the Lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a cell where ye may rest to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The portal opened; on the battlements<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moonlight shone, silent and beautiful!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Before them lay their path through the wide world&mdash;<span class="linenum">538</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nightingales were singing as they passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking back upon the glimmering towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, led by Ailric, and with thoughts on heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the lone forest held their pensive way.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From casque to spur. His brow yet wears a frown,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of steadfast vengeance, as his inmost heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet labours, like the ocean after storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sword unsheathed appears, which none besides<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Spears, with escutcheoned banners on their points,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above their heads are raised. Though all alike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are cased in armour, know ye not that knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who next, behind the king, seems more intent<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Before the seat, his armour all with gules<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chequered, and chequered his small banneret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Lord Fitzalain. William holds a scroll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his right hand, and to Fitzalain speaks:<br /></span>

<p class="fm4">ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.</p>

<blockquote><p>"This victory thus obtained, Duke William wholly ascribed unto God,
and by way of a solemne supplication or procession, gave him the
thankes; and pitching for that night his pavilion among the bodies
of the dead, the next day returned to Hastings, there to consult
upon his great and most prosperously begun enterprise, giving first
commandement for the buriall of his slain souldiers.</p>

<p>"But Morcar and Edwin, the unfortunate Queenes' brethren, by night
escaping the battaile, came unto London, where, with the rest of
the peeres, they beganne to lay the foundation of some fresh hopes;
posting thence their messengers to raise a new supply, and to
comfort the English (who, through all the land, were stricken into
a feareful astonishment with this unexpected newes) from a
despairing feare, showing the chance of warre to be mutable, their
number many and captaines sufficient to try another field. Alfred,
Archbishop of Yorke, there present, and president of the assembly,
stoutly and prudently gave his counsell forthwith to consecrate and
crowne young Edgar Atheling (the true heire) for their king, to
whom consented likewise both the sea-captaines and the Londoners.
But the Earles of Yorkeshire and Cheshire, Edwin and Morcar (whom
this fearefull state of their country could not disswade from
disloyaltie and ambition), plotting secretly to get the crown
themselves, hindred that wise and noble designe. In which, while
the sorrowfull Queene, their sister, was conueyed to Westchester,
where, without state or title of a Queene, she led a solitary and
quiet life.</p>

<p>"The mother of the slaine King did not so well moderate her womanly
passions as to receive either comfort or counsell of her friends:
the dead body of her sonne shee greatly desired, and to that end
sent to the Conquerour two sage brethren of his Abbey at Waltham,
who had accompanied him in his unfortunate expedition. Their names
(as I finde them recorded in an olde manuscript) were Osegod and
Ailric, whose message to the Conquerour, not without abundance of
teares and feare, is there set downe in the tenour as followeth:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Noble Duke, and ere long to be a most great and mightie King, we
thy most humble servants, destitute of all comfort (as we would we
were also of life) are come to thee as sent from our brethren, whom
this dead King hath placed in the monastery of Waltham, to attend
the issue of this late dreadfull battaile (wherein God favouring
thy quarrell, he is now taken away and dead, which was our greatest
comforter, and by whose onely bountifull goodenesse we were
relieved and maintained, whom hee had placed to serve God in that
church). Wherefore wee most humbly request thee (now our dread
lord) by that gracious favour which the Lord of lords hath showed
unto thee, and for the reliefe of their soules, who in this
quarrell have ended their dayes, that it may be lawfull for us by
thy good leave safely to take and carry away with us the dead body
of the King, the founder and builder of our church and monasterie;
as also the bodies of such others as whom, for the reverence of him
and for his sake, desired also to be buried with us, that the state
of our church by their helpe strengthened, may be the stronger, and
endure the firmer.' With whose so humble a request, and abundant
teares, the victorious and worthy Duke moved, answered:</p>

<p>"'Your King (said he) unmindfull of his faith, although he have for
the present endured the worthy punishment of his fault, yet hath he
not therefore deserved to want the honour of a sepulchre or to lie
unburied: were it but that he died a King, howsoever he came by the
kingdom, my purpose is, for the reverence of him, and for the
health of them who, having left their wives and possessions, have
here in my quarrel lost their lives, to build here a church and a
monastery with an hundred monkes in it, to pray for them for ever,
and in the same church to bury your King above the rest, with all
honour unto so great a prince, and for his sake to endow the same
with great revenewes.'</p>

<p>"With which his courteous speech and promises, the two religious
fathers, comforted and encouraged, again replied:</p>

<p>"'Not so, noble Duke, but grant this thy servants' most humble
request, that we may, for God, by thy leave, receive the dead body
of our founder, and to bury it in the place which himself in his
lifetime appointed, that wee, cheered with the presence of his
body, may thereof take comfort, and that his tombe may be unto our
successors a perpetual monument of his remembrance.'</p>

<p>"The Duke, as he was of disposition gracious, and inclined to
mercy, forthwith granted their desires, whereupon they drew out
stores of gold to present him in way of gratulation, which he not
only utterly refused, but also offered them plenty to supply
whatsoever should be needfull for the pompe of his funerall, as
also for their costs in travaile to and fro, giving strait
commandments that none of his souldiers should persume to molest
them in this businesse or in their returne. Then went they in haste
to the quarry of the dead, but by no meanes could find the body of
the King; for the countenances of all men greatly alter by death,
but being maimed and imbrued with bloud, they are not known to be
the men they were. As for his other regall ornaments which might
have shewed him for their King, his dead corps was despoyled of
them, either through the greedy desire of prey (as the manner of
the field is) or to be the first bringer of such happy news, in
hope of a princely reward, upon which purpose many times the body
is both mangled and dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>membred, and so was this King after his
death by a base souldier gasht and hackt into the legge, whom Duke
William rewarded for so unsouldier like a deed, cashiering him for
ever out of his wages and warres. So that Harold, lying stript,
wounded, bemangled, and goared in his bloud, could not be founde
nor knowne till they sent for a woman named Editha (for her passing
beautie surnamed Swan-shals, that is, Swan's-necke), whom hee
entertained in secret love before he was King, who by some secret
marks of his body, to her well knowne, found him out, and then put
into a coffine, was by divers of the Norman nobilitie honourably
brought unto the place afterward called Battle Bridge, where it was
met by the nobles of England, and, so conveyed to Waltham, was
there solemnly and with great lamentation of his mother, royally
interred, with this rude epitaph,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> well beseeming the time,
though not the person.</p>

<p>"Goodwine, the eldest son of the King Harold, being growne to some
ripenesse of years in y^e life of his father, after his death and
overthrow by the Conquerour, took his brother with him and flew
over into Ireland, from whence he returned and landed in
Somersetshire, slew Edmoth (a baron sometimes of his fathers) that
encountered him, and taking great preyes in Devonshire and
Cornwell, departed till the next yeare; when, comeing again, he
fought with Beorn and Earle of Cornwall, and after retired into
Ireland, and thence went into Denmarke to King Swayn, his
cosen-german, where he spent the rest of his life.</p>

<p>"Edmund, the second sonne to King Harold, went with his brother
into Ireland, returned with him into England, and was at the
slaughter and overthrow of Edmoth and his power in Somersetshire,
at the spoyles committed in Cornwall and Devonshire, at the
conflict with the Cornish Earle Beorn, passed, repassed with him in
all his voyages, invasions, and warres, by sea and by land, in
England and Ireland; and at the last departed with him from Ireland
to Denmarke, tooke part with him of all pleasure and calamitie
whatsoever, and attending and depending wholly upon him, lived and
died with him in that country.</p>

<p>"Magnus, the third sonne of the King Harold, went with his brothers
into Ireland, and returned with them the first time into England,
and is never after that mentioned amongst them, nor elsewhere,
unlesse (as some conjecture) he be that Magnus, who, seeing the
mutability of humane affaires, became an anchoret, whose epitaph,
pointing to his Danish originall, the learned Clarenciaux
discovered in a little desolate church at Lewes, in Sussex, where,
in the gaping chinks of an arch in the wall, in a rude and over
worne character, certain old imperfect verses were found."</p>

<p>A daughter, whose name is not known, left England with her
brothers, and sought refuge with them in Denmark.</p>

<p>Speed quotes Saxo Grammaticus, who says, "She afterwards married
Waldemar, King of Russia." To this daughter I have given the name
and character assigned to her in the poem.</p></blockquote>

<p class="fm3">ADVERTISEMENT.</p>

<blockquote><p>This poem was first published under the name of "One of the Living
Poets of Great Britain." I have thought it best to revise and
publish it in my own name, and as it is the last written by me, and
the last I may ever live to write, I have added, from volumes long
out of print, some selected verses of my earliest days of
song.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Since these were written, I have lived to hear the sounds of other
harps, whose masters have struck far more sublime chords, and died.
I have lived to see among them females<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> of the highest poetical
rank, and many illustrious masters of the lyre, whose names I need
not specify, crowned with younger and more verdant laurels, which
they yet gracefully wear. Some who now rank high in the poet's art
have acknowledged that their feelings were first excited by these
youthful strains, which I have now, with melancholy feelings,
revised for the last time.</p>

<p>It is a consolation that, from youth to age, I have found no line I
wished to blot, or departed a moment from the severer taste which I
imbibed from the simplest and purest models of classical
composition.</p>

<h2>ST JOHN IN PATMOS.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
War, and the noise of battle, and the hum
Of armies, by their watch-fires, in the night,
And charging squadrons, all in harness bright,
The sword, the shield, the trumpet, and the drum&mdash;
Themes such as these, too oft, in lofty song
Have been resounded, while the poet strung
His high heroic lyre, and louder sung
Of chariots flashing through the armed throng:&mdash;
But other sights and other sounds engage,
Fitlier, the thoughts of calm-declining age,
More worthy of the Christian and the sage;
Who, when deep clouds his country have o'ercast,
And sadder comes the moaning of the blast,
To God would consecrate a parting lay
Of holier homage, ere he pass away.

<span class="i0">His staff; and when the evening star arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Asia, a brief time he stood and gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sought his melancholy cave and prayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who, in this sad place, was this old man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, in this island, where the robber scowled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was this old man, exiled and destitute&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span><span class="i0">Old, but so reverenced, the murderer passed<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">At the last supper; he to whom the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking upon his countenance of youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His calm, clear forehead, and his clustering hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, What if he shall tarry till I come!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Long years&mdash;and many sorrows marked these years&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had passed since this was said; and now that face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was furrowed o'er with age; and weariness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exile, in the last lone days of life,<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were now his lot; for they whom he had loved&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, the disciples of "Him crucified"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Professing one warm faith, one glorious hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all, in the same faith and the same hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid down in peace, after their pilgrimage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the world ceased from troubling.<br /></span>
<span class="i16">He alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lingered when all were dead, with fervent prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon in the bosom of his Lord to rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he comes forth from his rocky cave<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gaze a while upon the silent sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the calm eventide of the Lord's day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think on Him he loved, and of that voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once heard on earth: so, pondering, on his staff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man watched another sun go down<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Slept, in the light of eve, beneath his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often, as in very gentleness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed to touch his sandals, and retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the last limb of the sinking orb<span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hid, yet far away the cloudy track<br /></span>

<span class="i14">Hark!<span class="linenum">73</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The "Angels of the Churches" upon earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Seven golden candlesticks," and He, the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among them, like unto that Son of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who radiant on the mount of vision<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now recognised the same, in the same shape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hair was white as snow; his eyes were flame;<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice, the sound of waters; in his hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His raised right hand&mdash;seven stars; his countenance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the bright sun, that shineth in his strength;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet serene as the descending day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the Lord: the old man at his feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell down as dead; the apparition stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious above his head, and spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Fear not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the first and last; the last and first:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, I am he that liveth, and was dead:<span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, behold, I live for evermore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For evermore, and have the keys of hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death!<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i5">The glory passed&mdash;and all around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is still as death: the old man sinks to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astonied, faint, and pale. When the slow sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggled to recollection, he looked around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet trembling; but no voice was heard; no form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, bending in its glory, o'er him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seemed the hills of that forsaken isle<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">More dreary; and the promontories bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted their weather-beaten brows more dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And desolate. Back to his lonely cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man passed; and, wrapped in thoughts of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span><span class="i0">Lifted in prayer his clasped emaciate hands;<span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on his bed of rushes in the cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay down to rest till dawn. What was his dream?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw again, as when the rocks were rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "darkness at midday was o'er the land,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Saviour calmly bowing his meek head<span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the cross: he heard that thrilling voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even from the cross, Woman, behold thy son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son, look upon thy mother!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Then he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forms of those whom he had loved on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard their voices still; and stood entranced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Peter and with James, upon the mount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of glorious vision; now he saw, in dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the glistening apparition rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stand above him. He has tarried long<span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lonely in the world: the vision comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To animate his hopes&mdash;to say, Live, live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me, for evermore! And, lo, the keys!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This opens the bright mansions of the blessed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This closes the eternal gates of hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the gnashing of the teeth, and groans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unutterable. So the Saviour spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As seemed in his sleep. Ah! the stern shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of murdered Cæsar rises: Art thou dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King of the world? for this didst thou proclaim<span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself a god&mdash;a living god on earth?<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the pit hide thee! But thou art a god!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bid the fury of these flames assuage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere they reach thee! Who shrieked?<br /></span>
<span class="i11">At the sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient and the solitary man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Started from sleep<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<span class="i7">The cold gray dawn appeared,<span class="linenum">138</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, standing opposite, with steadfast look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the glimmer of the inmost cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw a stranger.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Whence and who art thou?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling voice he asked&mdash;whence? who art thou?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps the spirit of this dismal isle!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, cast upon these melancholy rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poor and world-forsaken thing, like me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger gazed unmoved, and answered not:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His looks were those of pity&mdash;of respect&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mingling thoughtful wisdom with the grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauty. In his hand he held a book:<span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He opened it; and never light appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fair as that on his majestic brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now the sun had risen, and its beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot far into the cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">John gazed with awe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that majestic man, he knew not why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well might he have gazed with reverence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here, in this rude spot, he only saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men the most dark and savage of their kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murderers, and ruthless criminals in chains.<span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke to them of truth and righteousness&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke of an offended God! Some looked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the bright sun, defying; others turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttering. He spoke of pity, and they heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as the relentless hurricane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hears the last prayer of the faint mariner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom wintry waves had dashed upon the rocks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever with the gentlest offices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears and prayers the holy exile strove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wake their better feelings, for he laid<span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands upon the sick, and they looked up<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With hope and blessed him, and, restored to strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot the vows they made; him, too, who died<span class="linenum">173</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hardened, and, as to human eyes, in sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laid in the cold grave, and said a prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mercy to the God of all, the Judge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom all hearts be open, and from whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No secret thought is hid&mdash;and, self-accused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mortal himself, presumed not to condemn.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So passed this ancient holy man his days,<span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peaceful, amid the banished criminals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banished and poor himself, but living thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the sternest of their kind, he prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their salvation:&mdash;so he passed his days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peaceful, but sad; and now, with anxious gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned his look to the mysterious man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, steadfastly beholding him, thus spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The voice of prophecy has been fulfilled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is the Temple? where Jerusalem?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! wretched city! Famine, war, and woe<span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">That famished babe is black! Oh! turn away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All&mdash;all is silent now; and thou hast seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This prophecy fulfilled, for not one stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beautiful and sacred Solima<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is left upon another! He who died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he beheld the city, o'er it wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, O daughters of Jerusalem!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep not for me, but for your little ones!<span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender words&mdash;dost thou remember them?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem, Jerusalem! how oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I have gathered up those little ones,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is left unto you desolate! Alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How desolate! But even in those last days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warning was given, if yet they would repent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bloody sword, like a red comet, hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the Temple, and a strange sad light<span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat on the altar; while the inner gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untouched, at midnight burst its brazen bars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood wide open; armed men did fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the clouds; and, in the dead of night,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">So the fair city of Jerusalem<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of them who brought glad tidings of the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now risen on the darkened world!<br /></span>
<span class="i13">I sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a stone of fallen Jerusalem,<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat down and wept, when I remembered thee,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Like him, the mighty prophet,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> who of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watched the dark gathering of the clouds and rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood upon Mount Carmel, and beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great sea westward. Hark! Euroclydon<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, after, came a still small voice, which said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, visit John, sad and in solitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sailed from Joppa, in a Tyrian ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Rhodes: a skiff was waiting near the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the shadowy moonlight seemed to rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a pale mariner, who never spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conveyed me hither, swift as silently&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift, though the passing keel no murmur made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the dim sail no shadow cast. I looked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I had reached the shore, and it was gone!<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">I saw thy mountain-cave: I stood and gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A while on thy gray hairs as thou didst sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the same voice which came, after the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said audibly, Reveal to him the things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall hereafter be, as I unfold.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I watched when the great vision came to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing the voice and answer: it was sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To animate thy hope! Art thou refreshed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As now these airs of morn blow soothingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathe a sad repose? John placed his hand,<span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale and emaciate, on his breast, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy words might raise from earth the heaviest heart.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stirred the dark locks that clustered round his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A faint rose mantled on his cheek; his cloak,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To pierce a Roman soldier to the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were in the act arrested, for her sake&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trifosa, of the tribe of Benjamin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who owed her life and safety to his sword.<span class="linenum">500</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We reached the city: here she had a friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Widowed like her, who wept to hear her tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, wedded, and by Israel's laws made one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lived&mdash;a fisher toiling with his net<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain our daily bread; but soon my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat for a wider scene&mdash;for enterprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul of a young soldier; and with thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirring and restless, after twelve long months,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We came, by Tabor, to the western sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had a robber's cavern at the foot<span class="linenum">510</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Carmel, and oft skirred the neighbouring plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On my fleet battle-horse, with spurs of blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here I was joined by soldiers, desperate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And outcast as myself; we were a band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of secret and of fearful brotherhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tenanted these caverns. But my wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we were absent, and the cave was still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept, for the love of those who were no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembled, and wept for me. When I returned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary, at night, she sat and sang to me;<span class="linenum">520</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes, when she was alone whole days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wandered o'er the mountains, gathering flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hyacinths, lilies, and anemones;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when my hands were bloody, gave me them,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span><span class="i0">With trembling hand, and sadness in her look.<span class="linenum">525</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should I think, or sigh, or feel remorse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I not leader of the bravest band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever shook their flashing scymitars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the morning sun! But, oh! that look!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How has it thrilled, even to my inmost heart:<span class="linenum">530</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One child, the pledge of warm affection, died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now she roved in morning dew no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft, when I returned with gore-stained brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a strange, sad wandering in her eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! her gentle mind was gone! She sang&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazed upon my face&mdash;she smiled&mdash;she died&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her last words were, O Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem! I buried her in peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a name, among the mountain flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now my heart was hardened as a rock<span class="linenum">540</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the world. I heard no soothing voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never looked upon a human face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tenderness again; a darker shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passions gathered on my lonely heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till love, and charity, and pity died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may not say what I have seen and done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here I have lived a fettered slave seven years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here thy mild voice has called back to my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad recollections. Father,&mdash;and he knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed his withered hand, and cried again,<span class="linenum">550</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! father, pray for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i11">The stranger stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved, but tears were on the old man's cheek.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Another glorious angel came, who bore<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The kingdoms of this world they are become<span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever and for ever, he shall reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever and for ever.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Now the ark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God appeared; and round about the ark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a rainbow stealing through the rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ark of the new covenant: and, lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shining company stood with the Lamb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon Mount Zion, and a song was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of harpers, harping a new song&mdash;the song<span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life and immortality. And John<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then heard a voice&mdash;a voice from heaven, which said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Write, write, From henceforth blessed are the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in the Lord shall die, for they shall rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all their labours! Blessed are the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The shadows are departed; horse and trump<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are seen and heard no more; the trumpet's clang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies far away: the Apostle turned and prayed,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes upraised; and now, for pealing trumps,<span class="linenum">249</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard in the wind the lessening sound of harps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lessening, and still lessening, till the cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was silent; and the stirring winds without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone were heard, like sweet, sad melodies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered in old times; whilst he who stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him watched; and after, as the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly declined, they two conversing sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conversing of God's judgment&mdash;of the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which said to man the sinner, Dust thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unto dust thou shalt return&mdash;of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And immortality through Christ restored;<span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they deceived the time, till John, oppressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sights and sounds so terrible, lay down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sank to sleep, not to awake till dawn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, lifting high his ensign of command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bade the trumpet sound the second watch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John knelt, and prayed, Thy kingdom come, O Lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he who stood beside him, spoke unmoved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rome&mdash;Rome shall be no more! At dead of night,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To muse upon the fragments of her might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ancient glory passed as morning clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tremble for the judgments of the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the world!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Now to the cave retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For other visions of the things to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other fearful shadows, must thou see.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">John sat, and held his hands upon his brow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth seems to retire, and all the sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tumult and of woe at once to cease.<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then John was in the Spirit, and he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven angels, and, beneath, a sea of glass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled with fire; and on the sea of glass<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Those who had gained, on earth, the victory<span class="linenum">104</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the beast, all standing on the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of glass, and in their hands the harps of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus they sung, Oh! great and marvellous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou, Almighty God, and just and true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all thy ways, thou King of saints! Amen.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now from the temple a loud voice was heard,<span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which said to the seven angels, Go your ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour out the vials of the wrath of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the earth.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Then on the men which bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mark upon their foreheads of the beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fell down to his image, noisome sores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plague-spots fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">The second angel poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vial on the sea, and it became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood of a dead man; and every thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had the breath of life died in the sea.<span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the third angel poured his vial out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the rivers, and fresh fountains clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they became red blood. And then John heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In trance, the angels of the waters say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Righteous art thou, O Lord! and righteously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou which art, and was, and which shall be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus hast thou judged, for they have shed the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of prophets and of saints! A voice replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out the altar, Even so, O Lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almighty God, thy judgments are most true!<span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the fourth angel poured his vial out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the sun, and power was given to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scorch men with the fire, and they blasphemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of God, and still repented not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking with gnashing teeth upon the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the fifth angel poured his vial out<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span><span class="i0">Upon the kingdom of the beast, and, lo!<span class="linenum">137</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kingdom of the beast at once was dark:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men repented not&mdash;even while they gnawed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tongues for pain, blaspheming God in heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the sixth angel poured his vial out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the great river of Euphrates rolls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it was quick dried up, and so became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A highway for the armies of the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the kings of earth, and the whole world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathering to battle, on the dreadful day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the incensed Lord, into a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called "Armageddon," in the Hebrew tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the seventh angel poured his vial out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the air, and a loud voice was heard<span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the temple's inmost shrine, which cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is fulfilled! At once an earthquake shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ground, and lightnings, red and terrible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed, and the thunders rolled along the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strange and fearful voices in the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were heard, so dreadful was that storm. Aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nations fell; and the great Babylon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came in remembrance before God, to pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her the fierceness of his wakened wrath.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now John saw another angel fly<span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In clouds, and coming down with power from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the earth; and all the earth beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lighted with his glory; and he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the loud voice of judgment, Babylon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great is fallen! And then another voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered, Come out of her! Hath she not said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sit a queen, mighty as Ashtoreth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kings of earth shall tremble when they see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smoke of her great torment; they shall stand<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span><span class="i0">Afar off from her burning, and shall cry,<span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mighty city, Babylon, alas!<span class="linenum">171</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one hour is her judgment come! The voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of harpers and of trumpeters no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall in her streets be heard: the blood of saints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of prophets, and of martyrs, is avenged!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cries are heard, the smoke is seen, no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And after this, John lifted up his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the voice of mighty companies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sang and shouted, Alleluia! reign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever, Lord of lords and King of kings!<span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salvation, honour, glory, power, and praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be unto thee, O Lord! for thou hast judged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With righteousness! They, with acclaiming voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still sang and shouted, Alleluia&mdash;reign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever, Lord of lords and King of kings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard through the empyrean, the great voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again went up, whilst all the courts of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang, Alleluia! glory be to thee,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Then the heaven opened, and, behold! a horse<span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As white as snow, and he who sat thereon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was called "True and Faithful;" on his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were crowns on crowns, and underneath a name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which no man knew, save he who bore that name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vesture was a robe of blood, and they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who followed him proclaimed, The Word of God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the heavenly armies followed him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On horses white like his; and on his robe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was written&mdash;King of kings and Lord of lords.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The pomp is passed, and now John raised his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw an angel standing in the sun.<span class="linenum">201</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The angel in his watch looked down to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the armies of the earth came forth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Him who sat on the white horse! And, lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the mighty cherubims advanced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Michael, the great archangel, while a shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang, that the sun in heaven might seem to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still at a sound so terrible. Opposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great armies of the living God,<span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frown the Satanic host, far as the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can reach; and horses black as night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spectre armies, led, in front, by Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appear, receding into farther depths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blackness; while, anon, a dragon, scaled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moves weltering onward. Michael, from the ranks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cherubim advancing, lifts on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mace, and full on the scaled dragon's crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smites. At his feet the dragon lay, and, lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sable phantom-horsemen at the sight<span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are vanished. Raise the victor-song to Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rides on the white horse, and to his God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven, for the great dragon is cast down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the bottomless and burning lake!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Another angel, with white waving plume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descends; an iron chain is in his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dark key of destiny, which shuts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bottomless abyss, from whence the smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascends&mdash;ascends, but not a groan is heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient dragon is cast down, and bound&mdash;<span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound for a thousand years, in chains, and thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howling, into that nethermost abyss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While mercy, equity, and peace, and truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like angel forms, visit the earth, and move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Radiant as light, among the sons of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only sounds are heard of harmonies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as in heaven are sung about the throne,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O'er which, in dewy light, the rainbow bends.<span class="linenum">238</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trump of bannered war, the sighs and groans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of miserable slaves, that rise from earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one deep murmur, to high heaven, are ceased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love and mercy walk among mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so shall walk, till the last trump shall sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now a new heaven and new earth appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, coming down from heaven, even as a bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned to meet her husband, John beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The City of the New Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glittering beyond the clouds; and then he heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice from a bright cloud, The Lord shall come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dwell with men, and he shall be their God;<span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God shall wipe from every eye the tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death shall be no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">John spread his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, with eyes upraised to heaven, Oh! stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visions of bliss! I am bowed down with age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn on earth, and I have tarried long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone and sad. Oh! come, Lord Jesus Christ!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice replied, Thou shalt be where he is!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hark! 'twas the billow beating on the rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of melancholy Patmos, and John wept,<span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, slowly fading, like a summer dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the towers, and gates, and palaces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of New Jerusalem fade in the clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of eve, which shot its gleaming pinnacles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft in the pale sky, and flushed the track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sun's westering orb with crimson light.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As the sun sunk, the sound of trump and horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrilled, and the old man, starting from his trance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld below the cave the Roman troop,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span><span class="i0">Stationed to guard the island criminals,<span class="linenum">270</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wind slow, in martial file, with banners spread,<span class="linenum">271</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning to their tents.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Ah! where are now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temples of the New Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glittering amid the clouds of parting day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone, like the rack; and Patmos' dreary isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melancholy caves return the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of marching men, and the hoarse Roman trump.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Apostle to the entrance of his cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last remaining light on his gray hairs,<span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes slowly forth, and rests upon his staff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the rock-pigeon, at the trump disturbed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew to his withered hand. With plumed crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his brazen helmet, holding high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ensign of command, an eagle borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, on a spear, the præfect leads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His legionary band; and as aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banners wave, and shields and corslets throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back a pale glimmer, mark a mournful train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fettered men move sullenly, with whom,<span class="linenum">290</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful, and with his hands upon his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes, at times, uplifted to the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, as a soldier worn with toil, but marked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a stern sadness on his manly brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes silently, a tear on his dark cheek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near him, a youth, wan and emaciate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leans on a female, by his side, in bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of youthful beauty; while, at intervals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er the trumpet ceased to ring, is heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breath of muttering, and the clank of chains.<span class="linenum">300</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">John sighed, and, turning to the stranger, said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For both were at the entrance of the cave):<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to this desert spot in the lone waves,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
<span class="i0">War, and the ensigns and the sounds of war,<span class="linenum">304</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have reached.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His guest illustrious, with a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered: Yet this is the mere mimickry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that appalling spectacle, that fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world's wide scene with havoc and with blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The murmur of whose mighty coil goes up<span class="linenum">310</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still to the ear of Heaven. So man, the worm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preys on his fellow-worm. Turn from the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As gradual evening shades the sinking scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think upon its sins and strife no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Come, let us, on the stone, before the cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all above is still and glorious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit down, and watch the stars as they steal out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One after one, and garnish the pale cope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven. How bright the troops of Hesper shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the shadow of yon farther rock,<span class="linenum">320</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose western side is lustrous; for the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascending in her car of glory, casts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A meditative and a solemn light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From cape to cape! Look! there is Helice,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some solitary stars, now scarce discerned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As if to shun the prouder planet's gaze,<span class="linenum">330</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each in his watch, with never-blenching eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steadfast. Nor marvel, then the stranger said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To the invisible, Almighty Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rules in heaven and earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Is there a God?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! Nature cries aloud, There <i>is</i> a God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visible in his works, and infinite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In power! There is a God, and he is just!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a God, and he is merciful!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet might we rather say, there is no God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than think, that to a being such as man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No revelation of bright hope was given:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man, created in God's image, placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid this vast and unknown universe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sojourn upon earth a few brief years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of feverish life, should look, for the last time,<span class="linenum">350</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hopeless, upon the setting sun, and die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! better be the worm that feeds on him.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With lifted gaze, the last Apostle cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fervently cried, Oh! yes, Lord Jesus Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art the Christian's hope! but most of me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me, whom thou hast visited, and cheered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through life's long pilgrimage; of me, of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In age and solitude; I, too, shall live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the clouds of time are rolled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever live in glory where thou art!<span class="linenum">360</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Retiring to the cave, pausing, he turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his companion, but he was not there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon shone, but there was no form or shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of living thing; so lonely to his cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erwearied, John retired, there musing lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On what he saw and heard, till sleep unawares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppressed him, and that night&mdash;that only night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had not fallen upon his knees, and prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Protect me through this night, O Lord my God!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When, suddenly, a hiss was heard without,<span class="linenum">370</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dull hurtle, as of iron wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And short and intermitted flames, at times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighted the cavern roof; then all again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was dark, save when the moon dilated hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all again was still. John's heavy eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were closed; and dreaming half, and half awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He slumbered in the cavern. Who art thou?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starting, he cried, and trembled, for strange eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glared through the dusk, and seemed to look at him.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It was the coinage of the aged brain,<span class="linenum">380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sadness and the sense of loneliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppress the weary heart! His eyes are closed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment, when strange voices, in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Syllable words unknown, as mocking him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all is hushed again: from the dark roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fantastic and deriding shapes, half seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Point down long fingers, and a laugh is heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the dark fissure of the rocky cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till even his shadow, by a moon-glance seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems joining the fantastic mockery.<span class="linenum">390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange forms of beasts and birds, with monstrous beaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solemnly nodding, in the dusk appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yonder, by moonlight, all with heads hung down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There moves a shrouded and a moping train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a form distinctly visible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save of a corpse, that silently they bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the moonlight falls. Now a dark cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is interposed, and the dim troop dissolves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith a spectre, towering to the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moves onward&mdash;on, directly to the cave;<span class="linenum">400</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, towering higher as he moves, he lifts&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half cloud and half anatomy&mdash;a dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barbed with fire, and a deep voice is heard,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Through the involving clouds about his head:<span class="linenum">404</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am Apollyon; dost thou sleep, old man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tremble&mdash;and die!<br /></span>
<span class="i5">John raised his eyes, and prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still shuddering, Save me, save me, Jesus Christ!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spectre vanished: some faint lightning shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At distance; and now gentler forms drew nigh,<span class="linenum">410</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With airy minstrelsy of harps unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounding him, like shadows of the blessed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, radiant female forms came gliding by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in a stream of light, an angel turned<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John, gazing on the glimmering eastern surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat with fixed eyes, when thus the stranger spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up! for the Word and Spirit of the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are come to me. Let us ascend, old man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summit of Elijah's cliff, that hangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er the ocean surge, and see the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise o'er the Ægean solitude to-day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John answered, Can these feeble limbs sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The labour up the long and slow ascent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Step by step, when I feel my strength decay<span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily, and draw my breath with pain?<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Thy God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will give thee strength, the stranger said, and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His trembling hand, and led his feeble step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow up the hill; and ever as they went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the horizon widened, in his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John felt a strange reviving power, that braced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sinews, and gave a vigour to his steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conquering the pain and labour of the way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But needs not pain or labour, for a thought<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath brought them there, the white hairs, in the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of John, yet gently stirring, and his cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just lighted with a transient glow; and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both stood upon the promontory's point,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful and silent: soon they saw the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly emerging, a vast orb of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the shadowy edge of ocean; now<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Flaming direct o'er Asia, with a stream<span class="linenum">28</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of long illumination, on the clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marked with confusion of rich hues, and thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touching the nearer promontory's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale cliffs, and eagles' wings above the clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now careering through the heaven, supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full and magnificent, in loneliness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of glory. When the rays first touched his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then more exalted, and of larger frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger seemed to grow, as not of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or earth's inhabitants; so tall his form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So glorified his aspect. John had fallen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his knees, but a mild voice rebuked:<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">See that thou do it not; hast thou received<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or strength or comfort, give the thanks to God.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">John, resting on the crag of the wild rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked up, and then to his companion spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not uninstructive hath thy converse been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor unrefreshing to my weary heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy presence; more so, in a scene like this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised, as it were, above the shade and clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of transient time. And so, long since, my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt a divine refreshment, when I stood<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the mount of vision with our Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day when in transfigured form he rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! well do I remember it, who saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With James and Peter, by the sight oppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious apparition. Each stray cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandered far off, and lost in the blue sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a freckle stained the firmament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High overhead. The mystic mount itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tabor, seemed rising up to heaven, and loomed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such illumination, that the track<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, and all the plains of Galilee,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Rivers and lake to the great western sea,<span class="linenum">62</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked cold and dim, even in the morning sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the glory of the sudden blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wrapped the mount. The crowd of lesser hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to the city of Tiberias,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared below o'er which the eagle sailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute, for his eyes yet blenched from the excess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of light, unlike the sun, that startled him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bursting splendour, where he slept. He flew,<span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High soaring o'er the hills of Jezreel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to the mountains of Samaria.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fell upon the ground, and with our hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered our faces, when we raised our eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw three glorified appearances;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two, as of aged prophets, with their beards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streaming; each held a book, and in the midst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, buoyant in the air, his countenance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as the sun, our Saviour's form appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above them, while his vest, intensely white,<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floated, as thus transfigured he arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clasped hands, and eyes upraised to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peter, in joy and wonder, ardently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried: Let us build three tabernacles here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Moses, and Elias, and to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saviour and God! not knowing what he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud now interposed between the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softening its glory, while a voice was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bright cloud, Lo, my beloved Son&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear him! At once the shadowy imagery,<span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The visionary pomp, the radiant cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were rolled away, and Jesus stood alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they who held high converse, and whose forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared in thinner air, above the blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were gone with the departing cloud: his hand<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He placed upon our heads, and said, Fear not!<span class="linenum">96</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that calm look of dignity and love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was placed upon us, as before. Again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw the sun&mdash;the cloudless cope of heaven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long green valley of Esdraelon&mdash;<span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pines of dewy Hermon, and the smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nain, where once a widowed mother wept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lost and only son, whom Jesus raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From death's cold sleep, restoring to her tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joy; we saw the cavern and the cliffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Endor, where the wizard-woman called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from his sleep of death the prophet<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> old,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh! hills, and streams, and plains of Palestine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scenes where we heard, long since, our Master's voice,<br /></span>

<h3>APOCALYPTIC HORSES.</h3>

<h4>WHITE HORSE, RED HORSE, BLACK HORSE, PALE HORSE.</h4>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Black Horse</span>.&mdash;The period of the "black horse and rider with the
balance" is generally referred to the reign of Severus. But here
the commentators are at a loss. "The balance" sometimes betokens
justice; sometimes is considered as indicative of a season of
scarcity. The "black horse" is always associated with calamity. I
humbly differ from all commentators. The "horse is black," say
some, to show the "severity of the nature" of this emperor. But his
nature was generally the reverse of severity. Now I shall give
reasons for considering that "the balance" is the balance of
Justice, and the "bread for a penny, and oil and wine," indicative
of plenty, not scarcity&mdash;of plenty owing entirely to the prudent
provisions of this emperor; and in proof of this, as well as what I
shall say further on the subject, I adduce, not the testimony of
professed Christian commentators, but the <i>undesigned</i>
testimony&mdash;the stronger for that reason&mdash;of one of the most astute
adversaries of Christianity&mdash;Gibbon.</p>

<p>Now, Christian reader, mark his <i>undesigned</i> corroboration of the
veracity of this prophecy, as applied to Severus.</p>

<p><i>Scripture</i>&mdash;"Balances in his hand."</p>

<p>What says Gibbon? "Salutary laws were executed with inflexible
firmness." "In the administration of justice, the judgments of the
emperor were characterised by attention, discernment, and
impartiality;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and whenever he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> deviated from the strict line
of equity, it was generally in favour of the poor and
oppressed."&mdash;<i>Gibbon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scripture</i>.&mdash;"A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures
of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine."</p>

<p><i>Gibbon</i>.&mdash;"He left in the public granaries a provision of corn for
seven years, at the rate of 2500 quarters a day."</p>

<p>But the "black horse." Does this colour seem suitable to a period
of general equity and justice? How simple is one explanation, at
least so it appears to me, the first, I believe, who ever remarked
the circumstance, and how minutely does the singular fact tend to
attest the awful truth of the prophecy&mdash;"Severus was an
African!"&mdash;<i>Gibbon</i>. And the "horse is black," not as indicative of
calamity, but of the country of which Severus was a native.</p>

<p>The prophecy connected with the "horses" seems as regular as
possible, beginning from the times of the Apostle. The white horse
and rider is universally considered as emblematic of the gospel,
going forth "conquering and to conquer." The red horse is the horse
of blood, under Trajan, who literally took "peace from all the
earth." The pale horse designates the famine and dreadful
pestilence under Gallienus. I have shown, not from the writers in
favour of Christianity, but from the attestation of the most astute
and insidious writer against it, the regular succession and
wonderful accordance, in the several successive periods, of the
fact and the prophetic adumbrations. Under Gallienus, how
remarkable are these words, as applicable to the "pale horse," and
pestilence, in the third century, commencing about one hundred and
fifty years after the death of John! "Famine is almost always
followed by epidemical diseases: other causes, however, must have
contributed to the furious plague which, from the year 250 to the
year 265, raged, without interruption, in every province, every
city, and almost every family of the Roman empire. Five thousand
died daily in Rome; and we might suspect, that war, pestilence, and
famine had, in a few years, consumed the moiety of the human
race."&mdash;<i>Gibbon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Red Horse</span>.&mdash;"Take peace from all the earth." Trajan's
conquests. "Every day the astonished Senate received intelligence
of new names and new nations that acknowledged his sway. The kings
of Bosphorus, Colchis, Albania, &amp;c.; the tribes of the Median and
Carducian hills had implored his protection; Armenia, Mesopotamia,
and Assyria were reduced to provinces."&mdash;<i>Gibbon</i>.</p>

<p>For the elucidations of this last book, I have referred, generally,
to commentators, chiefly Bishop Newton, though the reader may
sometimes be disposed to smile rather than acquiesce.</p>

<p>But I cannot omit my own views of some particular passages. One
head of the beast, wounded, "but not to death," is most singularly
descriptive of the Roman empire, restored to strength and power,
under Claudius the Second and Aurelius. "And the beast which I saw
was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear,
and his mouth as the mouth of a lion." How unexpectedly do they
tally with what Gibbon says of the Roman empire at the time,
consisting of the "tyrants" (lions)&mdash;"soldiers," scattered through
the vast and various provinces, and "barbarians"&mdash;Goths, indicated
by the bear!</p>

<p>I may observe, further, that the "locusts and crawling things like
scorpions,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> issuing out of the smoke, are, first, locusts&mdash;the
innumerable northern armies; secondly, "crawling things like
scorpions"&mdash;the loathsome vileness attributed to nature by the
succession of Gnostic sects, depraving the beautiful code of
Christianity, and all agreeing in one doctrine, derived from the
Chaldean philosophers. The Genius of Evil, according to the
philosophy of the Chaldeans, produced the body, as Orosmades the
soul! Hence "forbidding to marry," unnatural austerities, &amp;c.; and
remark, one book of Tertullian to the Gnostics is called&mdash;what?
Scorpio.</p></blockquote>

<span class="i0">Why art thou come, man of despair and blood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these green vales and streams, o'erhung with wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These hills, where, far from life's discordant throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lonely goat-maid chaunts her matin song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sylvan glen, where age in peace reclines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothed by the whisper of his native pines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in the twilight of his closing days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the glimmering lake he loves to gaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like his life, sees on the shadowy flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The still, sweet eve descending! Man of blood,<span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break not his holy musings! Innocence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peace these vales inhabit. Hie thee hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the waste wilderness, the mournful main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To caves where silence and deep stillness reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where God's eye only can the gloom pervade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shroud thy visage in their dreariest shade!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if these scenes, so beauteous, may impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A momentary softness to thine heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let nature plead, plead for a guiltless land,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pause yet a moment! By the beard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By her who frantic lifts her helpless hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By those poor little ones, that speechless stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou hast nature in thee, oh relent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor crush the lowly shed of virtue and content!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No golden shrines can tempt thy plunder here,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Soft o'er the azure lake each Sabbath swells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No lighted halls that blaze till morn reply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sounds of proud, voluptuous revelry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one sweet pipe, by lingering lover played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheers the dim valley as the day-tints fade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst, 'mid the rocks, the torrents, and the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her little world, with pride, affection sees.<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Survey the prospect well. Soldier! dost thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Thy blood-red plumage waving o'er thy brow)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid the poor villagers, who in the shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their forefathers eat their virtuous bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hard oppression bend the prostrate knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or learn benevolence and love from thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dost thou talk of freedom! Freedom here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted with death-denouncing frown her spear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here joining her loud voice's solemn call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the deep thunders of the waterfall,<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hailed her chosen home: these dark woods rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her bold war-song on the rocks she sang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once a thousand banners to the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streaming, a thousand falchions brandished bare,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaimed her sons' dread homage: We will die<span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or live thy children, holiest Liberty!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh think of this! Alas! the voice is vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor injured land, thy brave, thy blameless train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lovely landscapes, bursting bright around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy gleam that echoed every cheering sound,<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy rocks that gleamed with many a high-hung cot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Freedom's holy name, avail thee not!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then rise, insulted country! in despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift thy brave arm so terrible, and swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swear thou wilt never sheathe the avenging steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou hast made the fell invader feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How vain the terrors of his glittering crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How warm the flame that fires a patriot's breast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How nerved their arm, opposed to tenfold might,<span class="linenum">69</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who for the dearest hopes, their homes, their offspring fight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hark! even now, methought stern Freedom called,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the wild shores of rocky Underwald!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rush like the mountain avalanche on those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, foes to you, my sons, are Virtue's foes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, where the legions of insulting France<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He will exclaim, whilst from his breast he draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deep, deep sigh, Avenge, O God, their cause!<br /></span>

<h3>PART SECOND.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was a child of sorrow when I passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet country, through your rocky valleys last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one whom I had loved, whom I had pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With honest, ardent passion to my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to another vowed: I heard the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the earth sank heartless, faint, and pale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till that sad hour when every hope had flown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought she lived for me, and me alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet did I not, though pangs my heart must rend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prove to thy weakness a sustaining friend?<span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I not bid thee, never, never more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or think of me or mine? As firm I swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cast away the dream, and bury deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in oblivion of the dead man's sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that once soothed, and from the soul to tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each longing wish that youth had cherished there.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But when 'twas midnight, to the woods I hied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despairing, and with frantic anguish cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, had relentless death with instant dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smitten and snatched thee from my bleeding heart;<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through life had niggard fortune bid us pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And withered with despair thy hopes and mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, yes, I could have borne it; but to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The accusing tear, and know it falls for me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh cease the thought&mdash;a long and last farewell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must forget&mdash;nor shall my soul rebel!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to my country's cliffs I bade adieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what my sad heart felt God only knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helvetia, thy rude scenes, a drooping guest,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span><span class="i0">I sought, and sorrowing sought a spot of rest.<span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">I roamed an exile, passion-crazed and pale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw your clouded heights sublime impend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And oft the rugged scene my heart endued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a strange, sad, distempered fortitude;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft on the lake's green marge I lay reclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring my moody fancies to the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when some hanging hamlet I surveyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wood-cot peeping in the sheltered glade,<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tear, perforce, would steal; and, as my eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fondly reverted to the days gone by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How blest, I cried, remote from every care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rest with her we loved, forgotten there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then soft, methought, from the sequestered grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the song of happiness and love:<br /></span>

VILLAGER'S VERSE-BOOK.</h2>


<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>The following compositions were written originally to be learned by
heart by poor children of my own parish, who have been instructed
every Sunday through the summer, on the garden lawn before the
parsonage house, by Mrs Bowles. The object, which, to the best of
my knowledge, is entirely novel, was briefly to describe the most
obvious images in country life, familiar to every child; and in the
smallest compass to connect every distinct picture with the
earliest feelings of humanity and piety, in language which the
simplest might understand; but which, from the objects represented,
might be read, perhaps, with some interest by those whose minds
were more cultivated. About fourteen of these little poems were
composed with this view many years ago; but it was not thought of
extending their knowledge beyond the village circle, to which they
were originally limited, except by a very few copies given away. I
have now added to the number, and revised the whole; thinking that,
when early education is so greatly extended, they may be found upon
a wider scale to answer the purpose for which they were written.
They may also prove acceptable to mothers in a higher station of
life, who might wish to impress upon the memory of their children
as they grow up, a love of natural scenes, combined with the
earliest feelings of sympathy and religion. Some of these verses,
such as "The Mower," "The Swan," <i>etc.</i>, are purposely designed for
the exercise of a more advanced intellect.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">To softer climes impatient roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where summer, still on some green isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rests, with her sweet and lovely smile?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus speeding, far and far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We leave behind the shortening day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true (the red-breast answered, meek)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other scenes I ask, or seek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every change alike resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear not the cold winter's wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When spring returns, the circling year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall find me still contented here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whilst my warm affections rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the circle of my nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I learn to pity those that roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love the more my humble home.<br /></span>

<h3>THE BLIND MAN OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is a poor blind man, who, every day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summer sunshine, or in winter's rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duly as tolls the bell, to the high fane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Explores, with faltering footsteps, his dark way,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To kneel before his Maker, and to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chaunted service, pealing full and clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask why alone in the same spot he kneels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the long year. Oh, the wide world is cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dark, to him! Here he no longer feels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sad bereavement. Faith and Hope uphold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart; he feels not he is poor and blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the unpitying tumult of his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As through the aisles the choral anthems roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul is in the choirs above the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And songs far off of angel companies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When this dim earth hath perished like a scroll.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! happy if the rich, the vain, the proud&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plumed actors in life's motley crowd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since pride is dust, and life itself a span,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would learn one lesson from a poor blind man!<br /></span>

<h4>A DRAMATIC SKETCH.</h4>

<blockquote><p>In this wise the Duke of Gloucester took upon himself the order and
governance of the young King, whom, with much honour and humble
reverence, he conveyed towards London. But the tidings of this
matter came hastily to the Queen, a little before the midnight
following; and that, in secret wise, her son was taken, her brother
and other friends arrested, and sent no man wist whither, to be
done with God wot what. With which tidings the Queen, with great
heaviness, bewailed her child's reign, her friend's mischance, and
her own misfortune, damning the time that ever she dissuaded the
gathering of powers about the King; got herself, in all haste
possible, with her young son and her daughter, out of the palace of
Westminster, in which they then lay, into the Sanctuary; lodging
herself and company there in the Abbott's place.&mdash;<i>Speed's</i>

<span class="i0">'Tis morn, awake! awake! Ah! they are dead!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There is a lily in one little hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When first the fane, that, white, on Kingswood-Pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrests, far off, the pausing stranger's ken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed the hymn of praise, and on that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which seemed to shine with more auspicious ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thousands listened to the prelate<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> there,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span><span class="i0">I saw a village-maid, almost a child,<span class="linenum">7</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as a light-haired cherub, undefiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From earth's rank fume, with innocent look, her eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meekly uplifted to the throne on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join in the full choir's solemn harmony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, then, how many boding thoughts arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, long ere varied life's uncertain close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those looks of modesty, that open truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighting the forehead of ingenuous youth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest these, as slowly steal maturing years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should fade, and grief succeed, and dimming tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then should the cheek be blanched with early care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin mark its first and furrowing traces there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With touch corroding mar the altered mien,<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave a canker where the rose had been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the sweet child, whose smiles can now impart<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Might bring down, when not anxious love could save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mother's few gray hairs with sorrow to the grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But, hark! the preacher's voice, his accents bland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold his kindled look, his lifted hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What holy fervour wakes at his command!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He speaks of faith, of mercy from above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heavenly hope, of a Redeemer's love!<span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence every thought, but that which shows fair youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing in the paths of peace and truth!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like a faint glory, on a daughter's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall each parent's love, through life, repay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And add a transport to their dying day!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thine was illusive fortune's transient gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And young love's broken, but delicious dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those mocking visions of thy youth are flown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou dost bend on death's dark brink alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light associates of thy vernal day,<span class="linenum">49</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where are they? Blown, like the sere leaves, away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou dost seem a trunk, on whose bare head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gray moss of uncounted days is spread!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I know thee not, old man! yet traits like these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon thy time-worn features fancy sees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another, or another year, for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply, "the silver cord shall loosed be!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then listen, whilst warm eloquence portrays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That "better country" to thy anxious gaze,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O aged man! lift up thine eyes&mdash;behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What brighter views of distant light unfold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though the loss of strength thou dost deplore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or broken loves, or friends that are no more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though gay youth no more his song renews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summer-light dies, like the rainbow hues?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christian hails the ray that cheers the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throws its heavenly halo round the tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who bade the grave its mouldering vault unclose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Christ&mdash;Christ who died; yea, rather, Christ who rose!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hope lifts from earth her tear-illumined eye,<span class="linenum">71</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sees, dispersed, the world's last tempest fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees death, arrested 'mid his havoc vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, at thy feet his broken weapons cast!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Admiring seraphim suspend their wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst, hark! the eternal empyrean rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hosannah, Lord of lords, and King of kings!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such thoughts arose, when from the crowded fane<span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw retire the mute, assembled train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their images beguiled my homeward way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which high o'er Lansdowne's lonely summit lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There seemed a music in the evening gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking back on the long-spreading vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought a blessing waited on the hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the last light from heaven shone on the distant tower.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Poor Linley! I shall miss thee sadly, now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not in the world; for few remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who loved like thee the high and holy strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of harmony's immortal master.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst honour him; and none I know, who live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could even a shadow, a faint image give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With chord and voice, of those rich harmonies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, mingled in one mighty volume, rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious, from earth to heaven, so to express<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choral acclaim to Heaven's almightiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou! Therefore, amid the world's deep roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sweet visions of young Hope are fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many friends dispersed, and many dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grieve that I shall hear that voice no more.<br /></span>

<h3>INSCRIBED TO THE MARCHIONESS OF LANSDOWNE</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go to assemblies of the rich and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blazing hall of grandeur, and the throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cities, and there listen to the song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of festive harmony; then pause, and say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is <i>she</i> found, who in her sphere might shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attracting all? Where is <i>she</i> found, whose place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dignity the proudest court might grace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, where the desolate and dying pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their cold bed; open the cottage door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask of that aged pair, who feebly bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er their small evening fire, who is their friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask of these children of the village poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this, at the great judgment, thou shalt find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's mercy, Lady, merciful and kind.<br /></span>

over the sacred well, discovered by Mr Warner, is eminently beautiful.

I. is on the banks of the Seine, near Les Andelys, the birth-place of
Poussin, and the retreat of Thomas Corneille. A single year sufficed to
form its immense fosses, and to raise those walls which might seem to be
the structure of a lifetime. When C&oelig;ur de Lion saw it finished, he is
said to have exclaimed with exultation, "How beautiful she is, this
daughter of a year!" It was the last hold of the English in Normandy;
and, under the command of Roger de Lacy, long mocked the efforts of
Philip Augustus, who came in person to invest it in August 1203. The
siege was memorable for its length, the incredible exertions of De Lacy,
and the sufferings endured by the besieged until its capture in the
following March.&mdash;<i>Wiffen's</i> "Memoirs of the House of Russell," vol. i.
